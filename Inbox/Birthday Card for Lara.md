Lara,

Am I sad we aren't doing kareoke tonight? No. But was it was worth it 2 years ago so that we could have "Cut my life into pieces" jokes to carry with us. And each year that has gone by I am more in love with you and more thankful to have you in my life. Although neither of us is thrilled about the idea of getting older, I cheris grow up with you and grow together more and more each year. 

Happy 32nd :)
Love you so much, 
Tim

Surpise! the card you thought didn't exist. There is noone else I'd rather have point out the poppy seeds stuck between my teeth, or the egg on my face :) I'm sad that we won't spend Christmas day together, but we can do our part to keep the spirit alive through onsie solidarity and facetime. I love you so much babe and hope you have an amazing time with the whole crew.
