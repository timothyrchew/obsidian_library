These are reflections about my renewed focus entering a season of engagement and the start of a new life with Lara.

The things that are most important to me now:

- At the highest level I want to order my time, my relationships, my career, my resources where my ultimately trajectory and motivation is to invest in God's Kingdom. I want to take have regular rhythms of taking inventory of my life, brining it to God, and asking him what is out of place and what I should adjust so that I am moving towards this goal.


On a weekly basis, I desire to build scaffolding and sustainable habits towards the following:

- In my relationship with God
	- daily, meaningul time to connect and spend time with God. it can look differnt from day to day. be creative. but this I know is the source of everything for me. This is where I am placing all my chips, and setting as the foundation for everything else. Build this friendship.
	- doing the hard, intentional work of surrendering and tackling areas of weakness in my life with God's help

- In my relationship with Lara
	- Engaging spiritually. Building the habits early on to estblish this as a bedrock of our life together and independently. Proactively modeling and leading in this are for us.
	- Finding ways to serve others with our financial resources and practical skills / gifts.
	- Pragmatic interpersonal growth and investment in the mechanics of our relationship.
		- individually: seeking my growth to avoid repeating the samemistakes that I made with Jenn, and to learn and grow in the areas of weakness that I know will surface again with Lara
		- collectively: being intentional at working at areas of weakness in our relationship
		  
- In my career
	- Take sustainable, incremental steps towards strategic learning and gOrowth each week.

- Enjoy the present moment
	- Life is flying by, and each season brings it own unique opportunities. Slow down and enjoy the present. Treat myself. Don't take the future for granted. Travel. Enjoy nature, enjoy art. Seek out new experiences. Invest in meaningful relationships. Pick up new hobbies. Build flight hours. Don't fall into the trap of fixating on what is next. Time is too precious, and now is all that is guaranteed. Learn to better stop and smell the flowers.
