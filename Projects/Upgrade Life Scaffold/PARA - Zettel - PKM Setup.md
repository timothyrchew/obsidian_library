# Approach to PKM

I will likely go with a hybrid approach between Zettel and PARA. I like the notion of Zettel and interconnected ideas that can grow and self-organize as time goes on. I like PARA's approach for grouping related notes on a smaller time horizon by project with a consistent folder structure that can be maintained across all my tools. I like the notion of progressive summarization that reduces some of the burden of going full Zettel and allows me to pick and choose what I want to summarize

Zettel doesn't have the concept of projects or actionability, while I like that PARA does straddle the world of actionability and knowledge in a way that is a bit more cohesive.

# PKM / Project Management Scaffold

Approach:
- Use PARA folder structure in Obsidian
- Pratice using Zettel withint the Resources folder

Next steps:
- Set up the absolutely simplest thing possible and then embrace that it will evolve and grow over time. Don't get caught up on needing to follow someone elses system. Pick and choose what I want, be ok with an impefect start. Just get started. I can incrementally improve it over time.
- The beauty of the fresh start- that is built in to PARA. drop everything into archives, start fresh, and then incrementally pull in the files i want.
- Set up an initial workflow from kindle notes, web capture, book notes, podcast notes into an inbox. Learn zettel by a hands on process.
- Work to incrementally dig into Tiago's full approach and philosophy to productive work, which rises above the specific systema and is ultimately more important than the system specifics
- Releive some stress from needing to set priorities on a narrow timescale, and put a little more effort and faith into the weekly / monthy review (look at Tiagos approach here)
