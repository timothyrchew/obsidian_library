- Waking up with intention. Don't spend a long time in bed wasting time reading the news.
- Get outside and start my day doing a prayer walk and stretching my legs in nature
- Block off social media during the day. Turn on filters, especially on my work computer to stop clicking away. Maximize my time at work so that I can shut it off and maximize my personal time away during the evening.
- Take physical fitness seriously, do something active every day. This is the investment in my future ability to enjoy life.
- Learn something new around a career area of growth every day
- Take a step to respond and grow towards God today
- Do something fun that is truly restorative. Show compassion and practice good self care.
