# Governing Principles

- The main question and motivation should be about what enables me to be the most productive with the least resistance. Don't fall into the trap of obsessing over the system.
- Work to keep my system modular so that it there is minimal pain for me to move between systems, or to use the right tool for the right thing rather than feeling like I need one tool for everything
- I should have clarify about both 30,000 ft level down to ground level regarding my goals and tasks
- It should be simplest thing possible to maintain. Systmes that need to be perfrect in order to be maintained are flawed. It could be perfect, but in reality if its difficult or too consuming, it will fail. It has to be pleasurably and motivating to implement and maintain.
- Think about this in terms of good system design in the software world (Pragmatic Programmer)
	- Easy to change, flexible architecture
	- DRY: reduce repeating info across more than one spot
	- no more complex than it needs to be

# Notes from Tiago on PARA

Past issues I have encountered
- not enough separation between projects (finite goals) and responsibilities (ongoing standard without clear end goal)
- lack of a coherant, trustworthy PKM system, resulting on project being bloated by reference material until they get so big they collapse and need to be restarted fresh
- trying to find a one-size fits all tool, rather then embracing a flexible approach that allows for multiple tools that each do what they are intended to do. PARA provides scaffolding that can be consisten across all apps and allow you to be more modular in your approach.
- lack of clarity around projects / areas can lead to an ever present set of projects for each week that feel like they never change or progress, which kills motivation. an alternative to this is a smaller set of projects derived from areas, that can change and be much more pointed and specific each week + more variety.
- dont be pedantic about organizing and review. be opportunistic and do it when you feel like it is needed or you feel inspired. the system should be resiliant enough to not fall apart without all the supporting rhythms / routines.

# Brainstorm Productivity System Pieces / Possible tools


- Quick capture inbox for tasks, ideas, random thoughts
	- Some kind of integration with web browser or alfred to quick capture from any desktop
	- test out:
		- tick tick or todoist
- Longer format note taking, brainstorming, journaling
	- usage:
		- focus on networked thoughts, graph views, backlinks. easy searching and linking. it probably makes most sense to do this all in one app. but especially if i am embracing keeping locally stored plain text files as the core, it give me the flexibility to mix and match different tools. mayeb it would be helpful to use a different place to dcument learnings from tech than i would be for me to journal. and maybe there is even a different place for brianstorming and reference lists. the key is that i do have clarity as to what goes where so that i can find it later.
	- Obsidian
- Project Management and tracking
	- usage:
		- ive usually focused on wanting really free from projects, but i might benefit from having a more structured, organized approach that would come from using Notion databases, trello, or something like things. it could also be fine to mix and match these, based on the type of project. trello might be best for one shorter, more defined project. maybe notion for another with database make sense. and then for a smaller or more finite, maybe i can fit it in a task manager. again, worth experiementing and picking the right tool for the right project. as long as i know where to go and where to find it.
	- Obsidian
	- Notion
	- Logseq
	- Org Mode
	- Trello
	- Things
	- todoist
- Project support, reference material
	- usage:
		- Most bigger projects will have a lot of tertiary notes and reference material that i want to keep track of but wont be structued as tasks or actionables.
	- Obsidian
	- Notion
	- Logsec
	- Any other note taking app
- Hard dates, times, reminders
	- Google cal
- Tasks and todo lists
	- usage:
		- once i have actual tasks for a given project, it could make sense to use a dedicated task manager that makes it easier to reference and check off as i go, without having to edit some document.
	- Ticktick
	- Todoist
	- Things
- Daily / Weekly notes. My day to day living document.
	- usage:
		- the bullet jounral approach of a single view that consists of both soft and hard tasks as well as a calendar view is what i have had te most sucess with. perhaps i could split this out into just a list of tasks and times. but my daily / weekly note approach seems to work well so why change it or try to make something else work.
		- how would i go about re-creating some version of this in a task manager? as an experiment i could try spending a week of using ticktick and my calendar as a replacement for my daily note to see how that works out
	- Obsidian
	- Pen and paper (bojo model)
	- Notion
	- Org
	- Logseq
	- Noteplan
- Habit tracking
	- 3x5 cards
	- TickTick
	- dedicated habit tracking app
- Meta- the foundational OS for everything above. Documenting the links between the different tols. Keeping a distinct, structure project that is about keeping my system running, doing daily / weekly / monthy reviews, maintaining the system
	- usage:
		- if im going to use multiple tools, its bcomes critical that i have a source of truth that maps out what goes wheere and is a map for all my tools that make up my productivity system.

# Org Mode vs Obsidian

Org mode pro / con
- Can pretty much do anything I want, with enough work and study put in
- No GUI, more arduous file navigation and searching
- Limited mobile, unlikely to change
- big time investment in configuration, too easy to spend time there rather than doing
- The outline mode is super natural for me and fits my workflow well
	

Obsidian
- Not as powerful, more limited native text editing capabilities
- Out of the box solves pretty much all the types of things ive wanted in Org
- Good mobile
- Markdown is a more common format, so I'll have better support moving forward
- Likely would want to pair with VsCode for some better editing shortcuts
- The ecosystem being build in js and css makes me immediately able to jump in and customize waay easier than trying to learn lsip and navigate the much older, harder to grasp emacs conventions.

# Ways to improve Org mode
- Check out `ranger` or `neotree` for better file navigation
- Check out dynamic blocks with `org-ql` to handle pulling in a rendering tasks inside `now.org` from other project files
- Actually use the agenda mode and the task management abilities within org
- set up `org transclusion` and try using in current form

# Ways to imporve Obsidian
- learn vim so I can start having better editing capabilities
- Set up a global quick capture with alfred
- explore NotePlan in conjunction
- look at the kanban plugin for my leetcode roadmap
- explore todo.txt integration for tasks and dates



# PARA

Projects: a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline

Areas: a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time

Resources: a topic or theme on ongoing interest

Archives: inactive items from the other three categories


Starer projects
- Upgrade Life System
- Clean + purge apartment
- Establish spiritual disciplines
- Read critical journey
- establish a sustainable interview / career dev plan for this next season
- relationship building: old and new reconnections. focused on potential groomsmen.

Areas
- Faith
- Health
- Relationships
- Professional Dev
- Work
- Productivity
- Recreation
- Finance


Minimalist key pieces to get started with:
- Goals:
	- specific things i want to focus on in the next 3 - 6 months
- Projects / Areas:
	- identify key active projects for now and setup consistent folders across notion, obsidian, ticktick. 
	- split between finite projects and ongoing areas
- Workflows:
	- day, week, monthly routines to keep everything in check
- Habits / Tasks:
	- use a task manager for now
- Vault
	- separate knowledge from actionalbe tasks
	- follow a good notetaking system (connect thought, tags) in Obsidian

My org system should do these things:
- At any point, I should know what I need to be doing to be most effective
- I should not forget shit, and I should fullfill my responsibilities to others and myself
- It should keep me on track in my daily life towards my most important long term goals
- I can dump ideas and thoughts into it, and be assured they will get put in the right place


Key tools to use right now:
- Task manager (ticktick)
- Notes / projects / workflows (obsidian, notion)
- Calendar (gcal)
