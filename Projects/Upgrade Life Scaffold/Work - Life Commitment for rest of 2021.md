Setting the course for work life balance the rest of 2021:   

- Create space every day. I need open space to sit, to reflect, to invite God and to give him the room to speak to me, to reveal, to receive what he has for me. This needs to come before everyuthing.
	- Alarm at 7:45. QT from 8:30 - 9:30. Start work at 9:30. 
	- don't check slack before 9:30am. Don't check when i wake up. Change my clockwise hours to create more space in the morining
	- commit to an hour of focused quite time each day. get more rigid about waking up earler in the morning to do this. Need to get militant about blocking reddit social media on my phone and computer in the mornings. Turn on the strict Freedom mode on my desktop and phone.
	- if I don't do it in the morning, I need to do it in the evening.

- How will I set boundaries on work? How will I deprioritize and wall off work, because I can't afford to let it invade my personal space during these next months.
	- no flight sim, no distractions during work. Don't let this start to slip.
	- set a clear start and end time, and then work with an intensity and focus. Squeeze as much as I can out of this time.

- Ruthlessly prune away distraction. What is the bare minimum I can do in the other parts of my life? Strip away the rest. Rethink my daily and weekly routines based on on this. Consider crafting a special dedicated routine that I will commit to specifically just for the next two months as an offering and invitation to God. It doesn't need to be sustainable long term, but I need to pull out all the stops for this specific season.
