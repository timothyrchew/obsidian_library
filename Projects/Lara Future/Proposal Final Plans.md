Lead in:
- So the plans tonight are a little different than what I told you. So first I wanted to show you something that I have been working on. I wanted to add a couple more pages to our scrapbook to pick up where you left off. 
- So why don't you take a look. My pages are not nearly as pretty, or craft as yours, but I had fun putting it together.
- So this last page is incomplete until this moment. So I want to fill this in with you now.


The Speech:
- Lara, There is not the a shadow of a doubt that I want to spend the rest of my life with you. 
- You are the person I want to go through the ups and downs with. You are my best friend, you are my soulmate, and I couldn't imagine a better life partner.
- Will you marry me?
