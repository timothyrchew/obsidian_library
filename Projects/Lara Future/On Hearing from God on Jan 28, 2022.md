I think I can place today, Jan 28 2022 as one of the days I feel as though I've heard most clearly from God, right up there with 2-3 other moments in my life.

At the beginning of this month (on NYE actually) I told Lara that I am intending to move forward, but that I felt as though I still had a little more work to do and that I wanted to finish therapy and I wanted to make sure I had fully dealt with everything, so that when it came to proposing, I would move forward with a clean slate and a clean conscience. Internally, I wanted to continue laying it all down at Gods feet, and I wanted to continue asking him for one more month in which he would guide and speak to me. Here are the notes that I wrote down after speaking to mom and dad on NYE, before seeing Lara.

From Mom:
- We can get too focused on the big fork in the road, while neglecting to submit to God in all the little forks that we encounter throughout the day. I should make sure that I am submitting to God in all the small steps, if I want to hear from God in the big step.
- Focus on having getting a clean conscience of being fully submitted to God, fully willing to follow him, now and moving forward. From this posture, my conscience and be a clear guide. 
- If God is silent, it might be because I can't hear him if I have dulled his voice through disobedience in the other areas. Or if I have submitted to him, and I am standing infront of him with a clear conscience, and I don't hear a clear answer, then the situation is probably neutral- I can make the decision that I want to make.

From Dad:
- said that it could make sense to move forward to engagement at this stage, to continue exploring the rest of our relationship. That there might not be next level of revelation about our conflict management, decision making, until this next step. Not that I would be actively evaluating, but I would be more intentionally building and preparing for whats next. If red flags arrose, they could be dealt with and plans could be ammended.

Their thoughts on whats most important in a marriage:
- A willingness to admit wrong, a willingness to forgive
- A commitment to personal growth

What stood out to me after that call, was Mom's question about laying it all down, following God in the small, not just seeking his direction at a big crossroad, but choosing to fully submit to him in it all. And in some sense, I felt as though there was a degree to which I was still not putting it all on the table, in my personal life for one.

And so began my renewed focus this next month. Truly put it all ont the table, to step forward with courage to obey God in all, but especially in a big area that I have held out in and continued to feel a degree of hopelessness- with porn.

Prompted by a devotion from Every Step an Arrival, Lara and I talked about what God might be asking us to bring into the light. I told her I felt like porn was an area where I was feeling a renewed commitment to seek health and to encounter God, where I had previously given up in some ways. And that weekend i locked up some of the porn adjacent things for the week alongside the weed. It wasn't perfect, but it was a step to really give God the space to meet me.

That week I continued to seek God, I continued to try to lay it all down. I confessed to God that I deeply want to marry Lara, but that I will not do it if he tells me no. I begged him for guidance and wisdom. I asked him to show me if I am foolish or blind. I renewed my commitment to follow him in the big and the small, and to prevent me from making a decision that would hinder my ability to follow him fully for the rest of my life. I've held to James 1:5-6 in this time, asking boldly for wisdom.

I encounterd "Unwanted", and the paradigm of struggling with this ever persistent, traumatic struggle with porn began to shift. I began to see things with more grace, but also as connected to much bigger and much deeper issues. I began to experience true hope for change. I felt a gratefulness for God (and Gene's) revelation of a new perspective and path to walk in that seemed to actually allow for true healing and restoration- not a focus on porn, but porn as symptom of deeper hurts, to be approached without shame but with a sense of curiosity and a desire to find healing for the inner pain that my soul cried out for. It was no longer a path of restrictions and repression and hiding, but an invitiation to seek deeper healing of the soul. And in this time, through the lense, the desire for porn began to dissipate in ways that I don't think I have every experienced in my life.

Throughout this month, my time with God and my routines have waxed and waned a bit, but they have overall been there. And it has been life giving, through contemplation and lectio, to just sit with God, to bring it to him, to experience him, and to express my deepest inner heart longings for my future with Lara, for her journey, and for his guidance, offering it all to him. 

This last weekend in Michigan was filled with long days, but very special times of connection with Grandpa, with BAZZ, with the Bayne family. In that time I reflected much on the signficance of my childhood pain from being a missionary and the struggles and trauma of trying to fit in. I feel as though I saw how some of these pains did really shape some dynamics that Unwated spoke about. And in the relationships and connections of that time, I felt my soul being nourished and the desire for porn dissipated almost completely.

[[Unwanted Book Reflections]]

Two evenings ago, it had been a long day at work and I had just finished eating dinner. I was so close to just throwing in the towell and vegging out the rest of the night. Yet I decided I needed to just show up and to spend some time in prayer. And that was all it took. I took the first step, and God met me profoundly. I dimmed the lights and spent close to an hour just enjoying being with him, praying, pouring out my heart to him, and then putting on worship tunes and worshipping with tears streaming down my face. It was truly life giving and I was so thankful I took that first step to open the door for God.

I have been carrying around the burden, especially this month- of not sharing fully with Gene about Lara. I let a fear from way back- of being judged or his dissaproval about the interfaith aspect prevent me from fully opening up. I used the excuse of comparmentalizing this so that we could stay focused on the EMDR (which was legitimate for me early on) to not pull in this part of my life into our counseling sessions. But clear as my future with Lara has loomed, this aspect of hiding has been a point of tension and shame for me. In one conversation (probably 2 months ago), Mom asked about how much I had spoken about this with Gene. I told her not much. She said perhaps I would consider this being one aspect where I might choose vulnerability- as that has been a struggle in the past. For a while, I didn't fully consider this, or I considered sharing half truths about this- I didn't want to admit I hadn't spoken openly about this for almost 2 years- that felt too big to share. I was scared.

This past week- I can just say that I brough that to God. I told him of my fear, I told him about how sharing this now felt like too big a shift, I told I felt like I couldn't stand to share it. I just said I lay it down and I asked him to help me to grow. To help me in this situation.

This morning I had counseling. We spoke about my latest revelations through Unwated and the trip to Michigan. And then unexpectely, Gene said I think we are done. He asked if I though there was more work to do around process faith communtiy, or family and the desire to have kids- I said I felt at peace about both of those. He offered to do more work on "urge reduction" around porn, but I told him I think I would give this a go with Unwated and would likely circle back with him in the future. I was waiting for him to ask me about relationships- I kinda expected God to use him to really bring me into the crucible in this fear of mine. Honestly I don't know how I would have responded. But he didn't bring it up. I don't know if I was dissobedient, or if maybe this was God's grace in leading me one step at a time. Father forgive me for hiding in this area. I can say that genuinely I don't think there is much conversation we would have had at this crossroads about Lara that would have changed things, but who knows. Have mercy on me father. The positive thing about this area of my life is that I feel as though I am living honestly and transparently with every other major relationship in my life. I am walking much more openly.

And we spent some time reflecting on this journey- I shared me immense appreciation for him walking through all this with me. How I am in such a different place and how much hope I have, and how much more equiped I am. We talked about how I feel God's presense, and there is this well I know I can draw from for these future challenges- a well I didn't know how to draw from before. We spoke about how I have a faith to just take the next step, and how I feel like God has been gracious to meet me where I needed each step. Not unloading everything, but drawing me forward one step at a time with what I needed in that moment. And I feel a very real sense of peace and trust that he will continue to do this. I felt genuinely emotional expressing my thanks and appreciation to him- I though I was going to cry but I held it together. I'm truly grateful to God for Gene and how God has used him in my life. These past (almost) 3 years with him have left an incredible mark on my life. Thank you God.

Gene said it had been a priveledge to walk with me. He commended my courage and my persistence to not seek easy answers. And he said he was very encouraged by seeing God's work in my life, and that he was fully confident God would continue the work. His words were very kind and uplifting, after all that he had seen from me truly bearing my soul to him.


I had today off work. I reviewed all my journal entries / reflections about Lara and our future from the month of December. I went back and read all the articles and reddit threads I had saved regarding marraige, interfaith relationships, and what makes a relationship work. And then I wanted to just spend more time with God, more time bearing my soul to him. I decided to put on some headphones and to go for a walk along the lake. The weather was crisp, sunny, perfect. Just right jacket weather.

I listened to some worship songs that had resonated lately. And then I began to pray. I went through some of the normal prayer list items. I for a bit I felt somewhat stuck, still wavering, wondering how I hear from God. And I told him that, I just wanted to hear from him clearly. I prayed many of the same prayers that I had prayed dozens of times from my prayer list over the past months.

I sat on a stump by the river, with the sun shining on me. I got back up and continued to walk. For whatever reason, my more broad prayers for guidance began to organically morph into more specific questions. And as those questions began to flow out of me, I began to hear a faint voice responding to me. It wasn't loud, but just a sense that God was revealing his voice to me in respond to these soul questions welling up from deep inside of me. And surrouned by the beauty, outside, I felt God draw so near to me. I sat down and began to write out on my phone my questions and his responses. Even now, I can doubt that I was hearing him- could I just be hearing what I want to here. But this felt different. And this felt like it resonated and fit with what I can only describe as God's wisdom that I asked for in James 1:5-6. And in that moment, I felt God began to speak directly to me- about his love and care and guidance and plan. After i had written down everything I heard, I began to walk again. And then I continued hearing more- and it became more personal, more true to me. And in the middle of that trail, tears began to stream down my face, behind my sunglasses. And I just felt so sure that it was God responding to me clearly, in just the way I needed and just the way I had asked him. I sat down on a bench overwhelmed, continuing to write it down. And just thanking God, feeling surrounded by him in that moment, my hear overflowing with thankfulness, reflecting on the whole journey to this moment- through all the hardship and pain and loss, through all the work over these past years with Gene, with Mom and Dad, with Lara.

(In reflecting on this later, on the significance of this happening on the day I unexpectedlty finished counseling- it felt like God was CELEBRATING with me. Like he was telling me he was proud of my persistence, and he saw the work i put into this, and he wanted to show me his favor in this.)

God just showed up. And for this to happen on the day that my counseling eneded. And even the fact that my counseling ended today, when I actually expected still a couple more sessions.

I think this moment today will go down as one of the more profound moments with God that I can recall, up there with my exprience with God when my brain tumor first happened and when God met me in the middle of Grandma's decline in michigan. 

Here is what I jotted down on my phone while on the trail:
I had clear questions I asked God. I felt like I heard him respond in his first person voice. And then I felt at times more detail came to me (written in parenthesis)

Is there a path forward of flourishing with Lara?  
- there is always a path towards flourishing with me. There will be hard challenges but there is a path towards flourishing.  
- (i will will face unique challenges ahead, and at times I will feel very alone because most people of faith will not be able to relate or understand)   
  
Can you use this marriage for good in my life?  
- of course I can  
  
Is this outside of your will for me?
- depends on how you respond. you can respond in a way that would be outside my will, or you can respond in a way that would be inside my will. (It's not a binary, it's how I choose to respond to God and how I choose to continue following him. I could choose to not marry her and I could also choose to not walk with God in that path.)
  
Are you at work in her life?  
- I am at work in everyone's life. (He loves her deeply and has a wonderful plan for her if she will choose to follow him)
  
Can I play a role in her spiritual walk  
- yes. (It's her choice to follow him or not, but He can use me in her life)  
  
(I feel like God is telling me that he has given me his wisdom as I've asked. Now make a decision, don't be scared, have peace, and come follow him. It's my decision to make and he will be with me in either choice, just like he always has been.)
  
Can you redeem my brokenness of my last marriage?  
- I can redeem all things. I've never left you. I've known you from the beginning of time. I've made you who you are, and I have plans to bless and prosper you. I love you more than you can understand. Don't be scared. Just because you don't see it right away, I am still bringing about my plan in your life. Have faith. You have been through a hard time, and I'm proud of your persistence. I delight in you and you are my beloved.

Immediately after, I was just overwhelmed and encouraged by this signifcance of this encounter. After the immediate impact has faded a bit, here are some reflections. I think another strong reason I think I was really hearing from God is because it wasn't just what I wanted to hear. It was simple, yet direct. And I think it all lines up with God's wisdom. And the call was not to think in binary one time decisions, but to choose a path of ongoing decision to follow God and let the rest fall into place. And at this point, what sticks with me is how I have the tendency to want to place all the gravity on this decision, but what I felt like God showed me was that this decision is not the pivotal moment- it is the ongoing choices to follow him (or not follow him) that matter. I'm trusting that God would have told me no if there was not a path forward- I'm standing here with a clear conscience in my desire to hear whatever he would say, even if it was no. But he didn't say that to me. That there will be unique challenges with marrying Lara, but that there is a path forward of his blessing and provision if I do the ongoing work of choosing him.
