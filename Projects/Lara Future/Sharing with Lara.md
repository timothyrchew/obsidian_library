Focus on really wrestling with what my faith means to me, the role i want it to play in marriage and family, and what can be compromised and what i can't compromise. somehow working with the uncertainty that comes from being in progress- while still nailing down the things I do know will be true and will impact you. 

I want to be able to do a better job of articulating these things. Making sure that you have a clear picture, and that neither of us is making assumptions about how the other person feels.

Nowhere is this more true then when it comes to raising kids. Kept seeing this brought up as the biggest tension point if parents are not on the same page spiritually. That it can be find as two adults, but that all the difference surface and are magnified with raising kids.
