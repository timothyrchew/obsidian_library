Daily Holiday commitment:
- PRIO: lock up weed night before until 5pm
	- if i violate this, lock it up for mutliple days or the rest of the week. this time is too important to risk.
- PRIO: no video games or flight sim until i have done my reflection work
- leave the house to do reflection work
	- go to coffeeshop, walk lake trail, try mixing things up every day, get into settings that will help switch up my reflction times


Principles:
- Set the right mindset and expextstions for this time. It is not vacation mode. It is about working hard during the free blocks of time I have and connecting with family. If I do these things, I can actually enjoy my free time in the evenings more freely.


Specific goals:
- Work through journal reflection list
- Finish reading "saving your second marriage"
- Come to terms with a clear plan for our future. Its time to decide or be brutally honest with Lara. I always to push things back as far as I can to avoid making decisions until I have to. Same dynamics are at play now, so I need to create and enforce this deadline for myself now. Lara cannot do this much longer.
- Work through my list of "Marriage - Relationship Resources" and reflect
- Frame my next convo with Lara, continue updating her. Sharing my thoughts with her. Keeping her in the loop. Be really honest and open with her. I know that sharing where my mind is at helps her much more than keeping it private and keeping it ambiguous.
- Prep my life / work update for Renji, Baynes, others from old circles. Get rid of fear, meet God in the amount of anxiety I have now, and the pull I have to sugar coat or present what I think others want to see. Choose courage, surrender any anxiety or fear, and root myself calmly and confidently in my true story of earnestness, honesty and openness about my journey. Don't be afriad of being challenged, but also remember that true friends will meet me where I am.
