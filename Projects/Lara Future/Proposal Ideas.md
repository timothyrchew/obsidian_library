Plan:
- Friday March 11, or maybe do a weeknight (wed / thurs) so it is even less expected. take that day off work, take the time to really clean and set up something romantic at my apartment
- Tell her we are taking a big day trip on Saturday and make her think it will be later that weekend
- Tell her Zeke wants to come over to my place, we will meet here and play a game, get ice cream after.
- come up with something special to say, share with her during that time
- set up candles, wine
- figure out something special for us to add to the scrapbook


Goals:
- Make the specific time to be a surprise
- Need to give her parents enough of a heads up
- Would like to tell brett ahead of time (and anybody else important)
- Would still like to spend a couple more times with B&A as engaged couple (not right before their departure)
- Give myself enough time to make the space nice, to make it special and personalized to us
	- add a page to our scrapbook?
	- order some decorations

Dinner options:
- Tillery

Ideas brainstorm

Create a new page in the scrapbook, where we can document this moment together (bad idea, but something with a checkbox yes/no?)
Set up a scavenger hunt that takes her around the apartmnet. all the prompts could go into the scrapbook when we are done.
- toothpaste: squeeze from the top
- hiking: trusty but time to replace with something more sturdy. joke about goats
- sleep mask or earplugs
- frozen grapes
- cactus from mom
- french press and coffee grinder

Set up candles and rose pedals path
