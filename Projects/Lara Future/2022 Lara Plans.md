Foundation:
- Fully commit to obedience and following God in all the small ways, so that I can stand before him with a clear conscience, not playing games, not chosing what to submit to him. Come to God from this posture, confess my feelings and my desires, put it all on the altar and offer up my future with Lara and ask for his divine wisdom and word. If its still neutral, then make a decision and move forward boldly with integrity, continuing in complete submission to him.
