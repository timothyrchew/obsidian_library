Steps:
- Ask Lara to show me some examples of what she likes. How involved does she want to be in the process? 
	- Talk about ethically sourced options, or does she not care? Mined gemstones- environental impact, human rights stuff. Lab created ones or antique (no ethical issues, no environmental concerns)
- Talk about budget with her, try to get a ballpark
- Identify the jewler that I want to work with. Stay away from big ones, find a small family jewler I can work directly with.
