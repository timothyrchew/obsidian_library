I was wanting to bring y'all up to speed on where my head is at regarding Lara and I. The last two and half years with Lara have been incredible, she's my best friend, she's my soulmate, and I'm absolutely commited to making her as happy as she can be. There was definitely some healing that I had to do from my relationship and things have moved slower than Lara would have liked, but I'm greatful for her being patient with me in that area, but where I am today, looking at the future I can't ensision a life without out and I'm incredibly excited about taking the next step her. My hope is to propose to her in March.

Marriage is more than just two people coming together, its two families taht are involved. It its important to Lara and I to include y'all in this big step. And so I wanted to ask for y'alls blessing in taking this next step together.
