things i need to do before proposing, share with her:
- i need to finish my therapy. im ready to move forward, but its really important for me to close the chapter. i feel like i have some of this baggage. the marriage book talks about the most important thing being to deal with your baggage. We are very close, working through fears of the future from my last marriage.

"Assess the high value of commitment. I can't emphasize enough the importance of commitment in sustaining lifelong love. Three doctors who studied six thousand marriages and three thousand divorces concluded, there may be nothing more important in a marriage than determination that it shall persist. with such a determination, individuals force themselves to adjust and to accept situations which would seem sufficient grounds for a breakup, if continuation of the marriage were not the prime objective. Commitment is the mortar that holds the stones of marriage in place."

What does she think would be grounds for divorce? What would be the breaking point for her?
