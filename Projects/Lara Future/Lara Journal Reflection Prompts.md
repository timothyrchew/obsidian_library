# Priority Journal prompts

A
- a more existential reflection on what it means to commit, what it means to make a decision. what the different lines of thinking are on this type of decision. what it can hinge on. what you can know, waht you can't know. how to deal with the insecurity and fear of the uncertain. what are the things that i can base my confidence in. what things i would be foolish to ignore.

B
- core question I need to answer at this junction with Lara is what I want my faith to be. How will my faith and commitment to God shape my life? How does it make any difference than if I didnâ€™t have God? What does it look like for me to to die to myself and take up my cross? What does it look like for my to lose myself for the sake of the Gospel

C
- what are my biggest fears about marrying her? are they founded or unfounded? can i realistically know more that would assuage the fears? would a stronger shared faith fill in those fears?
	- work specifically through my 3 core fears / challenges that i am addressing in my time with gene, and how they apply to Lara
		
D
- what are the 5-6 most important things to me in a marriage from what i learned last time? don't over spiritualize, don't say what i think is the right answer. what is truly the most important for me now?
	
E
- why do i want to marry lara? what give me confidence? am i being motivated by fear at all right now?
- what would i want to know to have best assurance? why do i actually want more time? what can I realistically know in the next immediate window? what do I do with the delta under the assumption that i have to make a decision or loose her in the next month?

F
- what concerns me about her character, her personality, her approach to life
	- thinking in light of how she has said she doesn't want me to point out things that bother her. doesn't seem open to constructive criticism. does she have a personal commitment to growth? is she willing to look at her shortcomings and to acknowledge them?
	
G
- In looking through all my notes, key journal writings and reflections, is there anything else I need to talk to lara about or anything else I need to share with her?
	- are there any part of me, or things i want to express of live out that i have been holding back? anything else I need to put on the table?
	- how would she support me or react if I decide that I want to tackle a sin or cut out a thing that is harmful, but that she might not see as being a bad thing.
	- talking more specifically about raising kids. what we would teach them. make sure that neither of us is making assumptions here about what compromises would look like here. assuming this would be talked about in much more detail in premarital counseling.

G
- how would i describe my decision to marry lara to uncle dave, to brett, to the most potentially critical. not out of concern about what they think, but out of a sense of seeing this through someone elses eyes and gut checking myself. does my reasoning and thinking hold up?
- what are the key things we would do and focus on during engagement? how long of engagement would I want? what would be the key additional focus or exploration during this time?

# On Deck

		
- What does repentence look like in light of my relationship with LL? What do I need to repend of as I earnestly seeks God's guidance in this area?
- is there anything where I'm still beating around the bush? Where I'm still holding back a discussion, or my views, or how I see the world? Is there any are where I'm not being fully real or honest with her?
- On homosexuality- how would I actually respond if I had a gay child? What would be my response to this?
- What are my sexual ethics, that I would want to pass on my kids? And comparing my past to Laras more open past, can I actually see any real benefit from my past? I'm not sure its so clear. I'm I just trying to hold on to some sort of legalism about this?
- On caring for parents, what can I realistically hope for or ask from Lara apart from just expressing my desire and commitment to care for them?
- On potentially making a career change in the future or changing my direction in response to God, what I can I reasonably hope for or ask for without knowing the specifics?
