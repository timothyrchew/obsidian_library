I had something profound happen to me yesterday, but it's hard to express it in words. Words aren't really adequate. But I had one of the more profound experiences with God I've ever had, I felt like God spoke directly and clearly to me in a way that has a happened maybe once or twice in my life. BUt it doens't happen fully through words, so I'm almost self conscious to put it into words because that is like 33 percent of it.

I've told you wanted to do my due dilligence, I felt like there was unfinished work in being fully ready. Obviously I shared my plan was to move forward, but I was going to prioritize the emotional / spritiual work to be fully ready.

That has been my focus, trying to bring my fears about marriage, my fears about repeating mistakes, my fears about uncertainty in the future. My fears about whether we have enough common ground in faith, not wanting to put any pressure on your faith, but also struggling with how to engage authentically with you in this area. Trying to bring this to God, trying to ask him for guidance about how to make sense of it and how to move forward. Asking the question, on an emotional level- God how do I move forward from here?

There at times this split between my head and my heart- this sense in which intellectually we've had these conversations. Intellectually I'm ready, and then emotionally each step its lagged a bit behind and has had to catch up. And thats because the wounds, the fears, they live more in my gut than in my head.

Yesterday, i justed wanted to spend time close to God. I put on headphones, and I went for a walk along the lake. Listening to some of my favorite worship songs. And then just praying many of same prayers I've prayed about us, just bearing my soul to God with my fears, my insecurities, my uncertainties. And I started feeling this frustration- like how come I haven't heard from God more clearly. Why doesn't he speak more clearly. 

I just found this kinda secluded spot on this trail, and went and sat down on a stump by the river. And after a bit of time, for whatever reason these specific questions started coming out of me- almost from a gut level and I just began to ask God these pretty specific things. And I really clearly heard God respond to me. It wasn't audible, but they were just these simple, direct responses that I knew was God answering in my very moment. 

I was just kinda in shock, and then I got really emotional. That meme with synglasses and crying underneath was me. I just felt like God was super close to me, and responding directly to me in these deep, candid questions that emerged out of me in that moment of vulnerability.

Is there a path forward of flourishing for Lara and I?  
- there is always a path towards flourishing with me. There will be hard challenges, and at times I will feel really alone because most people of faith will not be able to to relate or understand, but there is always a path towards flourishing.  

Can you use another marriage for good in my life?  
- of course I can  

Is this marriage within your desire for me?
- depends on how you continue to respond to me. you can respond in a way that would be outside my desire, or you can respond in a way that would be inside my will. its not about this one decision, its about a lifetime of choices to respond to me.

Are you at work in her life?  
- I am at work in everyone's life. I love her completely and I have wonderful plans for her if she follow me.

Can I play a role in her faith?
- Yes. Its her choice if she wants to follow me or not, but I can use you in her life.

Can you redeem the brokenness of my last marriage?
- I can redeem all things. I've never left you. Just because you don't see it right away, I am still bringing about my plan in your life. Have faith. I delight in you, and you are my beloved.

And then after that, I sensed God saying:
- Ok, I've given you the wisdom you asked for. Now make a decision, don't be scared, have peace, come and follow me.

And that was it. I was sitting on this bench, tears streaming down my face. Glad that nobody was aright around me. And I think it was one of these more profound experiences I've every had. I felt like God dropped right in to speak to these deep heart questions that bubbled out of me in that moment. They were very candid,
