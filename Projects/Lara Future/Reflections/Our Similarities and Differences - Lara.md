# What are Lara and I's important similarities that ground our relationship?

- she is truly my best friend, and i love just spending time and doing life with her. the foundation of true friendship is deeper than ive ever had in past relationships. we deeply, genuinely like each other and love doing life together. 

- We can both communicate deeply, with self awareness and honestly to one another. This has been tested in navigation discussion around faith and our future, and our past relationships. We have a history assume the best of the other person's intentions around heavy things. We both value honesty and not playing games. We value shooting straight and getting to the heart of the issue.
- We both approach our relationship with intentionality, wanting to know what we can do better and how we can make the other feel more loved.
- We are both willing to work to grow in our relationship. When one person raises an issue, a book, something to listen to, we have been eager to engage.

- We laugh so much together. I genuinely think she is one of the funniest people I know. We share a really oddball sense of humor and I don't think I've ever laughed so much with another person.
- We both genuinely like each others families. We both value family and deeply hold those relationships close.
- We enjoy spending our free time and recharging similairly. We have pretty close desires for enjoying recharging at home, with sprinkled in social activies. 
- Our approach to finances is similiar. We are both fairly frugal for our income. We both beleive in saving, not spending with excess. Given each of our incomes, I think the average person at our level would probably spend much more freely. 

- Our approach to decision-making is similiar. When it comes to weighing options, to exploring, to navigating issues- I feel like we are able to talk on the same level and talk through things as partners well.
- Our sensibilities around the types of people we like is very similiar. I think we both find similiar behavior annoying and appreciate similiar types of people.
- We both put a similiar level of care into our health and appearance. We both value staying fit and looking good. But I dont think either one of us goes overboard.
- We will both stand up for ourselves and our views, but I think we both know which battles to pick and will let smaller things go (happened with the prenup talk)

- We both think broadly similiarly about political issues.
- We both love animals and the environment

- I think we are very sexualy compatible. Neither of us is crazy adventerous, but we approach it with a shared sense of wanting to hear the others desires and wanting to meet them there. I may want sex a bit more but I think we have libidos in the same ballpark (but hard to say without having lived together).

- We both value our independence and our time alone. We like spending time together and also carving out space to do thinks independently.

- We have both suffered. We have both been betrayed, cheated on. I think we both have a depth that comes from having been through really hard, painful things.

 # What are Lara and I's differences?

- We are at very different places in our faith journey
	- I beleive she is moving and progressing in her walk towards God, but her final destination is unknown. The degree to which she fully embraces faith and a relationship with God is unknown. The degree to which she is willing to make sacrifices to follow God, or support me in making sacrifices for faith that affect both of us, is unknown.
	- There is a chance down the road that we would approach big decisions involving life values and direction differently due to the differences in our faith
	- There is a reasonable chance we will struggle to find a faith community that both of us enjoy and feel comfortable with. There is a chance we will struggle to find a place that we both feel good about raising kids in. I might feel like the community they attend is too liberal, and lacks the kind of clearer spiritual structure + framework that I would want. I might have to attend church or participate in a community alone.

Our basis for morality + ethics:
- For me it is rooted in faith but for her is about being a good person. Her ethics are more pragmatic and more maleable. For me its more absolute and outside of myself. I think I have seen very small slivers of this in the way she talks about things or scenarios. This scares me a bit, its never directly surfaced but I feel like she has a more relevativistic / pragmatic approach that could be meleable when its not convenient or easy

- I am more vocationally oriented with what I want to do with my life. I think she is more concerned about stress levels and feeling a sense of fullfillment or satisfaction with work. We are not totally different, but approaching work from different motivations. I think about work in a much more idealistic sense in terms of what I want to ultimately do. We have spoken in depth about this, and she knows that I could make a sharp pivot, but its still theory at this stage.


Raising kids:
- We will have different ideas when it comes to teaching about God, about right and wrong, about morality about sexuality

- Our views on sexuality are very different. This stems all the way back to how we view sex, our own sexual histories. 
	- Lara views sex much more casually, as something not something that needs to be connected to the full commitment of a relationship. When it comes to raising kids, she would be want to impart a more sex-positive attitude.
	- I am more conflict and have more points of hypocrisy in my apporach, but at my core I still hold to a more conservative sexual ethic. I would want to be more conservative in the way that I taught my kids about sexuality. While she is admittedly much more consistent and baggage free, I still am stuck beleiving on thing and living another way. I'm not sure my path is actually better than hers, but I can't shake the feeling like mine is safer and closer to a God honoring way.
		- My sexual ethic in principle is still connected to and subject to God's authority. She does not share this at all right now.

- Our philosophies of money
	- I tend to spiritualize money, possesions, generosity, frugality and connect them to the ideas underneath. I feel like my parents approach to money and living simply is at the very least an ideal embedded deep in my DNA. and even where I don't follow it fully, I respect it and its really important to me that Lara at least cognitively appreciates it and sees the value in that type of choice, even though I don't expect the same for us
	- Given Laras background absent of faith and with lots of means, its really quite amazing how similiar we are from a pragmatic standpoint. We both really value saving and living within our means. We both have a similiar approach to splurging in some areas. But her approach to money is missing the same sense I have around tithing, generousity, and (at least an idealized sense of) simple living.

- We both would probably spend our free time a bit differently- she likes movies and I like video games more.

- Our families and family background
	- we both love our families deeply and get along well with each others extended family. but they are so different in terms of values and background and finances.
	- how would this play out longer term?
		- I think it means bigger adjustments on each others part to fully acllimate...it won't be hard for me but it will involve a lot more flexiblity and adjustment for lara to integrate without feeling resentful or uncomfortable.
		- for her:
			- our family has to wing so many things do to our lifestyles...lara wants clear plans in advance
			- my family doesn't have nice stuff, we use hand me downs, we buy second hand, we don't eat nice food. this is all so different for her and will add some degree of stress and discomfort for her spending longer amounts of time. im worried she could come to resent that part or would not want to go visit them, stay with them. i worry about how it would be for her to spend a longer chunk of time at my parents place in MI.
			- my family lives according to such different values- i think she cognitively understands but when it affects her life it could be a lot harder for her
			- my family is rarely together, so when we are together we want to try to maximize the time, more time, longer time together. a scarecity response. whereas her family doesn't experience this the same way so their times together are much more chill. i think this could very much overwhelm lara.
		- for me:
			- i worry that i would constantly feel insecure about my family. her parents would be able to create a much more fun, exciting atmosphere for our kids. they would be able to give fancy gifts. they would be able to host fancy trips. i am worried that my parents would drift into the background a bit- that they would be relegated to second tier grandparent because they wouldn't have the same amount of resources.
