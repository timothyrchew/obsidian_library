In making a decision of this magnitude, with this many lifelong implications, how do I balance the head and the heart?

# The conventional christian perspective

The conservative christians say you should never marry a non christian, and that it is always going against God's will, and that it is going down a path where there is not a foundation for shared values, deep connection, and mutualuality and partnership because there is no shared spiritual connection. 

They place a ton of emphasis on the spiritual symbolism, and spiritual aims of marriage. They focus a lot on the purpose that is attributed to marriage (to glory God and mirror Christ's relationship to the church). They anchor it to something outside the marriage itself, and give it at least the perception of being more solid and less fickle since its not just about two people deciding to commit to one another. The commitment itself is given this extra immense gravity because of the symbolism, the biblical tradition, and the communities influence that it provides a greater sense of safety and security (whether its actually real or perceived).

I think its really important to be realistic about the fact that marriage is already very hard, and that differences in our faith journey will make things harder. Not insurmountable, but its adding more hurddles than if I marry someone with the same perspective. 

This perspective places a great weight on raising children in the faith, and protecting them from secular worldviews during the formative years. And surely this this approach of a strong faith perspective at an early age has a massive impact on the likelihood of kids embracing faith.

My thoughts on this perspective:
- Within this, its also important to acknowledge that the antidote is also not just as simple as me marrying someone who is Christian. I am definitely not within the classic Christian box either right now. I have much more in common with someone who is Christian than not, but there would still be issues and tensions around potential different views between myself and someone who is classically Christian. Someone who aligns with me from a faith perspective is going to be a very narrow slice under the broad Christian umbrella, and certainly not mainstream. And they would likely be in transition just as I am, with the possibility of ending up somewhere else in the long term as well.
- There can be a real tendency to overspiritualize the relationship and to downplay the degree to which marriage is just two flawed people, deciding to commit to one another, building a life together, and riding the waves of life. It can provide a false sense of security that everything will work about because of the shared faith (certainly a trap I fell into) as well as a complacency that can stem from feeling like things are unbreakable and the future is granted. I think there can also be a tendency in Christian circles to not look at much at the human element, the pragmatic relational issues around what it takes for two people to make a relationship work for a lifetime
- Faith still is a really pivotal issue for me. Our differences will cause significant strain and pain for me in the future. I would be foolish to downplay it. Not necessarily insurmountable, but very challenging. If I do move forward, I need to be that much more sure about the rest of it.
- There are examples of this working out, and the spouse grow towards each other and find true unity (the growth can mutual, or one spouse moving towards the other). There are examples where it didn't work out it led extremely hard marriages or divorce. And there are many shades in between where this faith would cause friction, distance, and dissapointment but couples make it work. The outcome from this decision is not set, and is not binary. But it is choosing a path with someone that is going to be bumpier and harder, so I better be that much more sure that we have the tools and foundation to navigate the extra hurddles.


# The secular, pluralistic perspective

The secular approach puts the emphasis on friendship, compatibility, and mutual benefitting from a marriage. It doesn't have the same ideological underpinnings as christian marriage, and it is pragmatic and focused on the trangible benefits of the relationship and the partnership.

Without the more elevated sense of spiritual significant, the secular view of marriage would be that if it stops being beneficial or life giving, then at a certain point it makes sense to move on.

Through a secular lens, differences in faith don't give much pause. Relationships are always about compromise and meeting in the middle, and so faith is viewed through the same lens rather than something that is uncompromisable. 

There are people with incredibly resiliant, commited life long relationships without the basis of faith. So clearly its possible to build this kind of deep, selfless commitment outside the bounds of faith.

This perspective does not worry about the burden of imparting a specific faith perspective on kids, and tends to say kids can choose for themselves. But it ignores that this in and of itself is a faith worldview that will much more likely lead to a God-less worldview.

From this lens I ask these questions:
- Is she my best friend? Do I want to grow old with her?
- Can I cherish her and value and respect her even if she moves the opposite direction about faith and about life direction?
- Is she the person I want to tackle lifes problems with? Is she the one I want to grow old with?
- Is she the one that I can't picture life without?

Reflections:
- There is no question that rates of divorce are lower with people who are serious about their faith. Just because that was my outcome, it would be foolish to think it is meaningless. The fact is that there is statistically a higher chance of divorce if I marry someone without a strong faith than with a strong faith. There is no question a strong faith is a substantial augmenting piece of security when riding through the hardest points of marriage.
- I think there is also something to be said about the fact that the commitment is not taken for granted in the secular view. This is probably moreso true for me approaching a second marriage. I know I need to work at it, I can't take her for granted, and I need to constantly be investing and cherishing her. I need to be ruthlessly practical in choosing our battles, finding compromise, finding humor in the hard parts, and choosing each other.
- Because I feel like our pragmatic approach to resolving conflict and working through issues so far has been so positive, I resonate with the pragmatic approach to building a marriage.
- The secular approach is going to ignore the fact that I am not secular, but that faith is tremendously important to me. That two secular people will not feel a void, but that I have the potential to feel an enourmous void that she could be oblivious to and that she could not feel as much.

# The fearful, divorced mind

This part of me looks back at my experiences, and it is driven by a fear of being alone, a fear of betrayal or rejection, a fear of abandoment, a fear of failing again.

This part of me says that I only have one more shot. That people get a pass for one divorce, but not too. It says that if I mess up this next one, that there is no reasonable chance I have of marrying again- that this is the end.

This part of me is also tempted to draw too broad or too sweeping conclusions about the failure of faith in my first marriage. It is too quick to say because faith failed me the first time around, why bother with it the second time.

This part of me is more likely to not take my partner for granted, it is more likely to work harder, to be more gracious, to be more intentional.

This part will likely downplay my role in my first divorce, and will probably tend to see myself as the victim, rather than owning the fact that I was a leading contributor to the circumstances that then led to her having an affair.

# The rational mind

The rational part of me says I only have one more shot at this. It says that I would be foolish to make a decision for a relationship that objectively has more cards stacked against it without the strong share faith. It knows how hard marriage will be, and it says that in those moments I am going to regret that I choose the harder path.

This part of me envisions a future where Lara has reversed on the faith part, and where we see very different vision of how to raise kids and where we are headed in life. Where I am an anxious mess over worrying about influences on our kids, what we teach them, what they watch, how Lara might influence them on topics that have suddently moved out of the hypothetical and into the realm of laying the foundation for my kids, the loves of my life. I can see myself looking back and saying you knew this could happen. You have every warning, every chance to choose. There was no hidden decision, you looked it in the face and this was what you choose.

I envision us being in the depths of an argument- of struggling to communicate, of resenting one another. And of feeling this sense of fear that I don't know if she shares the commitment to making it work. I feel a fear that she migth be entertaining other men. And in those moments I can't fall back or appeal to some mutual commitment to God or to a faith community. It is just two broken, hurt people adrift, trying to sort things out without the structure or external help of faith, mentorship, community.

# The romantic mind

The romantic self looks at her in the eyes, and realizes that I have never loved someone else so deeply. She is my best friend. I feel as though I can be completely honest with her, without the same pretenses or judgements that came with opening up about harder, messier things in the context of a faith driven marriage. I feel safe and as though I can be my full self around her wihtout the fear of judgement or walking on egg shells. There isn't the same sense of hiding or trying to maintain some perfect christian ideal infront of her.

This part of me looks at the inevitable challenges that we are choosing if we move forward, and it says "this is the person I want to do this with. she makes it worth it."

This part of me feels a deep sense of confidence and resiliency that is rooted purely in the fact that she is truly my best friend, i love spending time with her, and i admire the person she is and how she moves through life.

This part of me looks at the tough conversations we have had around our relationship. It looks at how she has always led with honesty and how she has met me and how she has grown and opened herself to new perspectives. it looks at how she has embraced ANC and the relationships there. And it says "i am so proud of her, i am so proud to be with her, i want to face the rest of life with her".

This part of me looks at her relationships with friends, how she treats her family, how she treats her friends (including her christian, possibly trumpy ones), how she treats my family, and it says I don't know what lies ahead, but this is who I want by my side.

This part of me realizes that every realtionship, every commitment is fragile. That life will throw curveballs I could never see. That every marriage is two people on a journey, and that each person will be in a different place in the future. That nothing is guaranteed, except challenges. And it says despite all of this,  she is the one I want to be with, she is the one I will choose. 

# The unfied, integrated self

The wise path forward involves integrating the tensions between these disparate perspectives. I seeks unity and wholeness carved out between opposite poles. 

It acknowledges the there is wisdom even in old perspective or hard perspectives that I would be truly foolish to ignore. I also acknowledges that there is more life outside of the boxes than I realized before.

I don't think there is a right or wrong choice here. I don't think Jenn was necessarily the wrong decision. I am on this journey and I don't know what lies ahead. We have freedom of will, and different choices come with different consequences. 

Every marriage is a sort of calculated risk. I should feel freedom to make the best decision I can make right now. And once that decision is made, I will move forward with God, facing whatever comes my way. 

The key, I think now, is that I want to do my best to hear from God now. To listen if he raises flags, or makes it clear I should not move forward. To do my best to be within his will right now. And then to walk forward confidently. 

Lord God help me to integrate this wisdom and perspective from these different places. Help me to hear your voice, to make a wise decision, that is not based in fear or control. Help me to let go and to surrender to you.
