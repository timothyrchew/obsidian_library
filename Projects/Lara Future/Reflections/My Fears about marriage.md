My main fears:
- Her loss of faith, or stagnation of faith
	- The associated loss of our connection without being able to share faith. Deep dissapointment and loss if she reaches a future point where she doesn't find meaning in faith and she wants to dissasociate. I fear the massive differences and lack of shared meaning and connection that could arise from this.
	- That I would be hindered from fully living out God's call or direction in my life
	- That we would be at an impasse when it comes to raising children, establihsing a framework for them, being on the same page in terms of what we would want to teach and impart
	- That we would be unable to find a church community that we would both connect to and find meaningful. That they would be either too conservative for her, or too liberal for me.
- Fear that we would not share the same undying commitment to marriage when stuff gets really hard. That without the same underpinning and "divorce is not an option" perspective, that things would be more fragile
- Fear that I get it wrong a second time and ruin my chances of a meaningful relationship in the future. That once divorced isn't usually a dealbreaker, but twice divorced starts becoming a dealbreaker.
- Fear of being betrayed, fear that I would not live up to her expectations or hopes and that she would look to someone else to meet those needs
- Fear that I don't have what it takes, that I return back to old habits when the going gets tough, that I would stop holding up my end of the deal. That I would start having regrets or doubts and that I would again escape, withdraw, and numb like I did with Jenn. 


What I can reasonably do about these fears:
- The one big issue that truly has to do with her, and not just my own baggage, fears or insecurities, is the faith aspect. And the type of certainty or assurance I am looking for here will not come within the next year, or even the next couple years. And if I go looking, there are lots of examples of lifelong christians that hit a crisis and walk away from faith down the road. In some sense this happened with Jenn even though she had been a committed Christian her whole life. I simply can not be guaranteed success or an outcome in any of this.
	- However this is not to dismiss that there is a spectrum of likelihood of outcomes. And that being so early, the range out outcomes is more unpredictable with her. The most reasonable thing I can do with her on this front is to continue having lots of direct, tangible conversations about these issues. And to start trying to live that life now, engaging and taking steps now.
	- See engagement as a super intentional window to dig even deeper into this stuff. As we now hash out the specifics, we can do this together in a tangible way that we haven't been able to do. This can be seen as the final vetting period. Consider a longer engagement?
- Continue the deep work of doing my therapy and addressing the fears that are based in the past, and the baggae from my past.


What I need to return to:
- To love and commit is to risk. I loved and I risked before, and it didn't work out the way I hoped. I can see God's hand in retrospect. I want to seek God in this decision now. And if I move forward with God, I can continue to trust him with my future moving forward.
