She is truly my best friend. I could never say that fully about Jenn.

What I've seen of her character
- How she relates to my family, despite the massive differences
	- Kind and gracious, assuming the best of them. Not holding their differences against them. Valuing them and understanding their perspective and why they've made the choices they have
	- Hanging out with Grandpa, not getting upset as he made some comments about UMC and the gay issue, where he lands with that. Being gracious and present with him.
- Stretching to meet me in the faith stuff. Making big strides in exploring things she would not have explored before, engaging with community, taking the daily steps to pray and do the lectio sessions. Setting asside many of her preconceived notions to step into this world. Getting to the place where she said this would still be part of her life if we were to break up.
- How she goes out of her way to make sure Juan gets communion. How quickly she was to jump in and serve it to him.

How we've walked through this stage of her waiting for me:
- She really has done everything she can and is at peace with that. She hasn't taken any of this personally, she has assumed the best of me and hasn't held this against me or let it turn into resentment.
- She has been really honest and upfront about her feelings. She has been able to talk about them without getting angry, even when its very emotional.
- She is compromising and stretching on so many things- from this being my second marriage, to the brief talk about a prenup, to the resources she would bring into the marriage, to being open to my vocation pivot in the future, to supporting my family, to me tithing 10 percent, to engaging fully in church. She has done so much meeting in the middle and hasn't "kept score" or held this against me.

I love how she handles relationships in her life- with old friends, with her family, with coworkers. She really values them, and is truly a great, thoughtful friend to so many people. 

She talks about things head on. I can see how much she really tries to not let stuff burn away inside of her, but tries to bring it up and surface the tension points.

I love her ability to relate and connect to people. I really admire how she can turn that on, but also isn't a super extrovert that wants tons of high energy social things. She is an amazing partner and helps me stretch on this ways, but also likes to recharge at home in the same ways that I do. 

When we have hit some bumps in the road with travels, or faced stressful logistics and delays- she's been resiliant. Even though we both have had it, we are able to laugh and find the humor in the things going wrong.
