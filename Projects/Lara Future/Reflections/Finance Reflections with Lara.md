# On a prenup

https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/834dhj/cmv_there_is_no_reason_to_refuse_to_sign_a_prenup/

I have a track record:
- we did not have a contested divorce. I left with about 25k in cash and no house and just my immediate things. I didn't fight tooth and nail, I didn't drag us through litigation. I let things end peacefully and I took the high road, when I could have easily fought more to get my "equal share".

On principle:
- There is no such things as my assets and your assets, its our assets.

# On Accounts

- if we keep them separate, and we earn different amounts that can create this different power structure. What happens if one of us stay home.
- i do kinda like the idea that we each have separate accounts with xxx amount of money that gets deposited each month. we can each have full autonomy with that money.
