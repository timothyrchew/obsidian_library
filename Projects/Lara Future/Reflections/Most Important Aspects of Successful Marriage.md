- Be able to argue well:
	- Assume the best, most gracious interpretation of the other persons motivations
	- Be able to step out of emotions to talk about things rationally
	- Be able to dig into hard, messy conversations without having to beat around the bush or avoid the hard things

- Being independently happy and secure in who we are as individuals. Coming together as partners out of a plsce of confidence and self assurance.

- Dealing with dissapointment and hurt in a healthy way- through forgiveness and grace.

- A deep commitment to making this work, and pushing through the hard things even when it doesn't feel worth it.
