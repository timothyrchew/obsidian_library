# What am I waiting for now

More evidence, more commitment, more clarity about the degree to which lara is embracing and committing to faith for the longhaul.
- Either affirming: Maybe there are some things she could express, or we could talk about that would be helpful and clarifying
- Either concerning: Maybe in the process of egaging more with scripture, more with devotions, that would surface things or red flags about her not feeling good about the faith side and not willing to connect.

Some divine word from God, some revelation, some penetrating word from someone I trust.
- looking outwards for signs, for something to illuminate the path forward


# Where I am today

If the faith piece was somehow conclusively resolved, my fears would pretty much vanish and I would be ready.

But in light of that not being something that will happen, I am left with a series of shades of grey.

There is not a single voice I trust that would say its not foolhearty to marry someone who is not a beleiver. As broad strokes of wisdom, this is at least backed up by Paul in Corinthians. 

If Lara was not open to God, was not taking steps to engage, was not willing for this to be something that we share together, I think I would be unwilling and absolutely foolhearty.

What is her faith?
- It is not fair to call her an unbeleiver. I am confident she has a genuine beleif in God, and is really opening up to Jesus as divine. I am confident that she has seen the beauty and the value of the spiritual journey and has a desire to own this for herself. I have seen her move significantly in her openness and her steps to own this for herself. 
- In terms of our collective discussions, at this stage I am not holding back anything in terms of my own faith journey, my prayers, my struggles. I am not censoring my thoughts, I am not beating around the bush in terms of what I share with her. I am not trying to manage spiritual conversations between her and my parents.
- She has gotten fully involved at ANC. She has initiated connections with people there. She has asked great questions. She has enjoyed and gone every week with me.
- She has developed her own personal connection to God via her daily morning prayer time and following with lectio divina.
- She has been always been willing to engage in discussing with others (my family, people at anc, her own christian friends) about faith matters and what it means for us. 
- I've articulated the full expression of what faithfulness to God looks like for me, for our family, for our potential kids as clearly as I can, expecting myself to grow past where I am. I have done my best to express this as tangibly as I can. She has not expressed any concern, and says all of that fits with her vision and her expectations.
- She is looking for me to lead her in this area, she's said this is a muscle she doesn't have yet. And that just because she doesn't articulate it or bring it up, it doesn't mean that she is not thinking about it a lot. She has always been willing to engae in the ways that I have asked her to. 


For all these reasons, I don't think our situation is as black and white as "don't be unequally yoked". 

Being soberminded about the decision:
- Stepping forward will mean that there will be very real challenges and additional hardships that we will likely face because of our differences in this area. Right now I feel as though this is a choice that I can make, and that I need to prepared to accept the consequences and hardships if I take this less certain path. 



# What happens next?

I don't make decisions until I have to. I wait right up until the deadline incase some additional, unforseen peice of information comes through that helps me make a more informed decision. The most comfortable and natural thing here would be fore me to do the exact same thing- to wait until she draws an ultimatum, until she can't wait any longer and then to decide at that point.

But that is not fair to her, and it denies the fact that I know most of things I can know...without waiting for a significantly longer time, likely years, to have the kind of certainty that I want.


I can't shake the feeling that I don't feel like I can say yes I'm ready right now. Every part of me wants to say yes. I feel like I see clearly the risks, but I feel at liberty to choose either path- I don't think there is a black and white answer here. But I'm terrified of the choice, terrified of it going wrong. And my gut reaction is to just kick this down the road. 

What can I tell her? I want so badly for this to come to an end- for her and for me. I hate this limbo, this uncertainty. And as I'm at this threshold, I'm so scared. 


What I can tell her now:
- I have done a lot of thinking, processing, journaling, praying over the last weeks. About my faith, about our future, about what is most important to me. A couple things have become clear to me. I can't imagine a future without you. I want to spend the rest of our lives together. My intention is to propose to you in the first quarter of this year and for us to be married by this time next year.
- The second thing has become really clear to me- is that its really important to me to finish the work I am doing, so that when I put an engagement ring on your finger, I can do that with a fully clean conscience that on an emotional level, on a spiritual level I've done the work and I'm holding nothing back. That step represents turning a chapter, and its so important to you, I owe it to you that I am giving you my all. I am so close there, but I have not crossed taht finish line yet. I hope you know how much I am prioritizing this. This has been my singular focus over this break. And this will be continue to be my main focus these next months.  
- I want you to know where my head is at. I know how excruciating this wait is. I hate how this makes you feel, and I am doing everything in my power to be able to set us up for the best marriage possible. There is part of this inner process that takes revisiting, takes time every day, and I can't just arrive or solve immediately. I hope that gives you a sense of something to hold on to. 



# What is next

- Do the scripture focused devotional that establishes more of a baseline of theology without being reformed or legalistic
- Explore praying together
