From Mom:
- We can get too focused on the big fork in the road, while neglecting to submit to God in all the little forks that we encounter throughout the day. I should make sure that I am submitting to God in all the small steps, if I want to hear from God in the big step.
- Focus on having getting a clean conscience of being fully submitted to God, fully willing to follow him, now and moving forward. From this posture, my conscience and be a clear guide. 
- If God is silent, it might be because I can't hear him if I have dulled his voice through disobedience in the other areas. Or if I have submitted to him, and I am standing infront of him with a clear conscience, and I don't hear a clear answer, then the situation is probably neutral- I can make the decision that I want to make.

From Dad:
- said that it could make sense to move forward to engagement at this stage, to continue exploring the rest of our relationship. That there might not be next level of revelation about our conflict management, decision making, until this next step. Not that I would be actively evaluating, but I would be more intentionally building and preparing for whats next. If red flags arrose, they could be dealt with and plans could be ammended.

On whats most important:
- A willingness to admit wrong, a willingness to forgive
- A commitment to personal growth
