# The tension

There is a lot of anxiety and tension that I feel when I think about connecting and catching up with people like Renji, the Baynes + Redford people, and others from my past life and the more conservative end of the spectrum.

I tend to want to run away from the tension, by trying to subtly distance myself or "put them on hold". I try to avoid sharing too much, or letting them into my life at this stage where I'm scared they would see the real me and the degree to which I have changed and am living in ways that they would disaprove of. 

I still truly value and appreciate them, and I do really care about them. I don't want to lose the relationships. So I end up walking on eggshells around them, having anxiety about future interactions. And in many ways dreading actually having to interact with them, scared of what they will think if they know the true me at this stage.

# A Better approach

- The truth is, there is tremendous value in having people in my life with different perspectives that help me gutcheck my decisions and actions. It is important to have people that will be willing to challenge me and tell me what they really think from another perspective. This doesn't mean that I have to listen, but people that will still love me while speaking truth are people that I need in my life. If I'm only surrounded by people who think the same and see things the same, I am in a dangerous place of easily living in self-deceit and an echo chamber.  Whereas, if my choices are valid they should hold up to outside challenge and scrutiny.

- When I feel the tension, I should be thankful for it. I should press into it. I should explore it. No tension probably means I am being complacent, coasting, and at risk of self-delusion. If my goal is really to follow God, to take these things seriously, then the sense of tension that arrises from these interactions is something I should value and be thankful for, as they are the catalysts and check ins that can keep me grounded and can add some balance to my life journey. I should accept this as a good thing from God.

- When I feel anxiety or the desire to hide, that is what I need to give up and let go of. That is patently not from God and not what I am about. I am choosig to walk forward in transparency. I don't want to return to hiding or shame. If someone chooses to reject me because they disagree, then that is out of my control and it is a clear sign they don't need to be in my life. However I want to be the type of person that can listen to someone else's perspective or ideas without getting defensive, with giving them the benefit of the doubt, and sincerely listening and considering. 
	- What I can do and should always be striving for is to make choices that are consistent with my intentions and values, and to make choices I can stand by. If there is a gap in what I say is important and what I am actually doing, and someone else points that out, I should thank them, because I don't want to tolerate that in my own life. I don't need accountability according to someone else's values, but I should always value accountability when it comes to my actions aligning with my own stated value. Always seek to live this way, and I can walk into any kind of interactions, even with types of people that I associate with past negative religious experiences, and I can hold my head high and be free and confident in who I am...even as I still acknowledge the unknowns and acknowledge I am on a journey and I am still figuring things out.


# My internal fears

The notion of fighting sin, of doing this really hard work, is wrought with feelings of failure, shame, self-loathing. It brings about a sense of draining the life out of me, of continualy self deprivation and struggle, culminating in inevitable failure and low self esteem.

Much of this was at the center of the unraveling of my faith- this sense that I couldn't grow, I couldn't break through, that I was a constant dissapointment to God and I was unacceptable to him.

I felt like my repeated failure with porn meant I was a failure in my entire faith, and undermined my whole relationship with God. 

These last couple years have been just giving up the fight, and just looking for God. The reality is that I don't have the guilt, and part of me is like I have managed to moderate weed reasonably. And porn is more than I'd like, but it also hasn't seemed to have a hugely negative impact on me. I feel like I should have more guilt, or more negative consequences. Maybe that will come in the future, and I am still earlier in the process of giving in to sin where it more fun and less deadly. 

I know that this type of faith- all love, warm fuzzy, easy faith is not a vibrant full faith. Perhaps there is more love and grace here than I initially thought. But the Bible is crystal clear that we don't set the rules in terms of what is right and wrong, and that a living faith means doing the hard work of fighting sin for Gods sake.

Perhaps the start of my journey back to God needed to be just about re-experiencing God's love and grace with no string attached, even when I was still living in rebellion. But I've always known that if I continued, there would come a time where I needed to pick back up again, and really open the door here show God to show me a better way.

I want to find this balance, and I want to re-engage with God in this. I want to give him a chance to show me how to tacklet his, not from a place of obligation to some accountability group or community, not from a place of shame or fear, but truly just for Him and his sake. I want to tackle this because I want to please God, and I want to see how he can work in my life with me.

In many ways, the hard work to grow in character and to put off sin is the meat and bones of faith. What if I'm missing the experience of God's character and love and mercy because I'm too scared of failure?

Be bold, courageous with God. I will fail. Thats ok. Leave behind legalism, leave behind performance driven faith, and seek instead a path that focuses on posture of my heart and seeking God in these areas. The important part is do keep engaging, keep getting back up. And to seek to know God and be known by him in this area.

# What I will do

- Be in prayer about asking God for help here, to yeild to Him, to show me how to take good steps forward here. Ask him what he wants me to do now, put it all on the table.
- Start building the habit of Failing Well. Start taking steps with God. its ok to fail, its ok to mess up. Focus on the posture, focus on meeting God in this, and being obedient in my intention and effort. Leave the results in his hands. Open the door for him to meet me. I will fail, and thats ok.
- Finish reading the Critical Journey, understand where I have come from and how I might get unstuck and move forward in maturity and submission to God.
- Apply secular wisdom in both motivation and pragmatic approaches to change. Harness pragmatic secular truths in understanding tangible damange and harm. Avoid separating the secular from the spiritual in these areas- integrate both where it serves to augment and strengthen my approach.
	- Look at the secular nofap approach.

- Read material from both the progressive and conservative side about dealing with sin, addiction, growth. See what I can pull from revisiting old perspectives from my current space, as well as exploring new perspectives on growth and tackling sin. Put asside prejudice, and be on the search for real, sustained, life giving spiritual change and growth.

- Work to apply what I glean from the whole spectrum of practices. Courageously pave a way forward that is about my posture, my commitment, my pursuit...and not about the outcomes or destination. Focus on walking with God, waiting on God, and opening the door for him to meet me and to transform me through my small offers of obedience.
