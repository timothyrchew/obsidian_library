Why do I feel the urge to go deeper into the emotions of futility, shame, self loathing when I begin the cycle downward? It doesn't even seem like the sexual desire is driving it, its a compulsive urge to feel the shame and self loathing. Am I actually just trying to drive myself deeper out of a punishment? Am I failing to show compassion to myself in these moments?



Chapter 3: Dysfunctional Family Systems

  

I do think that I felt real moments of neglect, and I probably have downplayed this. I truly resented people like Takmina and Jacob, Ulan and others where I felt threatened and really jealous of how much my parents cared for them. I don’t recall the neglect specifically, but the fact that those relationships evoked such a strong reaction from me, even well into my adulthood, has to be a sign that those feeling came from a real place of feeling like I didn’t have enough attention, like I wasn’t important enough.

  

Add in the very strong feelings of wanting to move back to the states in the formative years. I think I have tended to put a bow on some of those feelings as I’ve gotten older, shrugging it off by saying that I gained lots of cool experiences, which is true. But I still need to acknowledge that I paid a real price for my parents decision to live a missionary lifestyle.

  

I felt truly unsafe and vulnerable as a kid in Kyrgyzstan. I was constantly looking over my shoulder, constantly worried about kids jumping me. Having to actually get in to fights to defend myself. Feeling like I had a target on my back. The closest thing to this that would map to conventional experiences would be that of bullying, yet I don’t really ever think of myself as having been bullied even though ithats probably a true statement. That sense of vulnerability, that sense that my parents didn’t understand it or respond to it probably had much bigger impact than I have probably imagined.

  

I resented my parents frugality and unwillingness to spend for things that would make our lives easier. They would make us take the bus and marshutkas when other expats had cars or dedicated drivers. I would always have to stand up and be hunched over in marshutkas. Our house wasn’t as nice as others. 

  

I was deeply lonely much of the time. It felt like I was always the oldest kid. It felt like for almost my entire very formative years in Kyrgyzstan I never had more than 1 real peer at a time. There was Sam and Dan burns, there was Luke Scott and that was it. All other kids around me transient relationships where we would briefly pass each other during furlough. In hindsight I had to have been incredibly lonely. All of my schooling situations all the way until BFA all had massive deficiencies from a friendship or extracurricular perspective. It was really not until my freshman year at BFA that I ever felt a true sense of belonging. That is staggering to look back at. So many truly formative years where I was in such isolation. And then that real sense of belonging was still so temporary. 2 consecutive years at it longest, and then it was all ripped away again. And I stepped into another world at Taylor where all the feelings of isolation, being an outcast, failure to connect, all came raging back. And I was so alone, so without community and friends. It was not until my 3rd year of college, with another fresh start and yet another rebuilding, that I began to lay foundations and began to find some stability, crating a new identity as a filmmaker and creative within Austin. I really left behind the MK identity.

  

Its kinda crazy in hindsight that I actually left home to live in a different continent from my parents as a freshman in high school. At the time it was exciting because it meant friends like me, it meant basketball, it meant living in a first world country. So all of that I think tipped the scales to where I just remember feeling excited about it. But was there more of a sense of this reinforcing that my parents would sacrifice so much of our time together, our closeness for the sake of missionary work? I don’t want to read more into the past than is there, I’m not sure I really felt this. But looking back on it from my perspective now and trying to imagine being a parent, and its so striking. I was absolutely surrounded by kids that were deeply wounded by their parents choices to send them to boarding school.

  

I think back to my sophomore year in the states as a heightened case study reflective of much of my experience as a TCK. I longed so badly to fit in, to be accepted, to be “normal”. I felt like such an outsider. The excruciating anxiety of sitting alone to each my lunch in the cafeteria. Of then desperately hoping that I would find Paul so that I would have just someone to sit with. The enormous school where I felt so invisible, so unlike the other kids, so weird and so awkward. Of going to the mall, of going trying to buy the clothes I though the cool kids were wearing. Of my limited friendships, even someone as gracious and kind as Marc was to me, yet still feeling this massive economic divide between us. He was this small window into being “cool”, and I’m so grateful for his kindness to me, but it also just proved how different I was. And the whole time I was trying to fit in, I knew I was just going to move away and all it would be gone. I tried to hide this fact from my few friends out of a fear that they would abandon me and that they would think any investment in our relationship would be not worth it. I think I made up some stupid story about what my parents did, where I was going, because I just knew it was so far outside their ability to understand. I was constantly hiding so much, trying so badly to craft some image that would be “normal” and would make me feel like I belonged. 

  

Yet even after such an incredibly hard year, I felt like I was making some inroads. I had some friendships. I made the basketball team, I did well in track. My drumming took off. And then it was all ripped away when we went back overseas again. Any bonds that were made were broken. Nothing lasted. Nothing was stable or predictable. 

  

Although I recall continuing to thrive at BFA, I distinctly remember Lane or Michelle sharing with me that I twas clear to them that I didn’t want to be back there.
