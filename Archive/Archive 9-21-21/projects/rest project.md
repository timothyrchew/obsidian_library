# framework for my free time:
- key principles:
    - don't fall into the trap of building some alternate escapists reality or letting any of these fun things take control over me (thinking about how stupid and endless the cycle has been of obsessively collectively building my hangers or feeling like i can't miss any 2k limited players even though i will never ever play more than one game with them, and the cycles for these will never end and are always fading away or falling behind). 
    - this is about enjoying the present moment being intentional about what i actually want (whether its engaged fun, or something educational or productive, or some mix of both) and also doing things that will actually meet this need and will be something that restores and refreshes me to better live a wholistic life and better pursue my main life goals
    - i don't want to fall into a rut of falling back to the default habitual things like flight sim or 2k if they don't deliver best. aim to mix it up and keep it fresh and well rounded.
    - i don't want to have to exert decision or consideration every thing i want to relax. it should be easy to start and something i don't have to think about. so its best that i actually put forthought and have a list to work from.
    - if i want something and will actually use it then buy it and enjoy it (as opposed to obsessing about trying to collect and save a bunch of found places and always looking for waht is new or what else i need to hoard in my collection).
    - always be looking for ways to steer my free time towards fun, interesting, useful educational pursuits that can straddle fun and productive outcomes (there can be some overlap here between items to try in this backlog and fun side projects i have listed in career dev)
- tactics:
    - check in a some daily / weekly interval to ask quickly reflect on the above and then to create a list of what id like to do or how to spend my free time over that period.

        - learn how to mod existing xplane, msfs third party aircraft. can i get access to the aerosoft source code? can i add an autothrottle to the hotstart tbm?
            - look at existing mods for p3d, msfs, xplan, dcs and examine the code, understand how it works, how the ecosystem works. look at the code snippets for the tbm auttothrottle addon. maybe look to become a contributor for one of the open source msfs projects.
