# Inbox stuff to learn:
- understand selenium vs other testing frameworks. how they implement the browser drivers.
- why do react hooks have to return the same thing every render cycle? how do react hooks work under the hood?
- how does ssh work under the hood
# Roadmap (interview in 6 months):
- grind leetcode consistently
- work my way through the developer roadmap github doc for frontend, backend, devops, systems design to fill in my knowledge gaps
- be intentional about high quality work and best practices, and opportunities to expand my familiarity while at work
# Strategy:
- daily career dev habit should be repeatable, predictable, and easily time boxed. alternate between leetcode and career skill learning. can switch this up over time.
- set a weekly career skill goal as part of my week review. pick something off the backlog and look to make progress in these ways:
    - daily habit
    - be intentional in using my work hours to pick up tasks related to this. be more intentional about harnessing my paid time to grow as much as possible.
    - at my discretion, consider booking other bigger periods of time outside of work and apart from my habits to work on this.
- set a weekly goal to read 1 chapter of a career dev book
- nice to have: the first two should be my primary focus with my primary time. but to add another dimension of growth, i should identify coding tasks or projects that would be genuinely enjoyable and something fun to work on after hours. something i can get lost in and something that is really easy to pick up. it could be aligned with my career skill or just a fun coding project to learn new things. this is the least important of the three areas, but something i can plug into to take it to the next gear. review this on a weekly level.
