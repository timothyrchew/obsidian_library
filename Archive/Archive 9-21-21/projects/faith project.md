# On Deck Actions:
- share my thoughts with lara about the treausre in the field analogy vs focusing on the window dressing. how i think it makes sense to understand the core of it, and to evaluate it on that level. and then to come back to the window dressing.
- Skim jesus feminist (for example of modern book)
# My Questions and Doubts
- look more at ways that jesus was the fullfillment of old testament prophecy. the beauty in the person of christ. why judiasm doesn't accept him as the messiah and why.

- spiritual: look more at the basis for the bible, and why we should trust it as accurate and worth basing everything off of it. see what kellers arguments are. what ravi zacharias argument is. see what other good arguments there are. look at the arguments against innerancy, and how they deal with interpretation with that in mind. look at different viewpoints as to how to interpret the cultural context in which lots of the bible was written, and if there are any implications for how we read it today.
# Personal faith actions
- ask and ponder and pray: more than theology, more than needing to subscribe to some set of beleifs...what does God really want from me? what is the heart of faith? what is the heart of Gods call for me? how do i respond to this, rather than getting sidetracked by needing to clarify these theological tensions (not that they are not important, but don't get sidetracked or distracted from ultimately seeking fervently to know God, and to respond to him. and committing myself to this full pursuit, willingly embracing challenge and willing to follow this where it may go, rather than trying to find a path that goes through the scenic route that I want to take or making God fit in my box. this is the danger i want to avoid with aspects of progressive christianity)
- look more at the person of jesus, the fullfullment of prophesy (and why people don't beleive he was the fullfillment), the beauty of the way he came, taking on human flesh, relating to us, and paving a way. look for a book that could tie all this together and help me see this with fresh eyes, building off some of the moving God has doen in my heart during this Christmas and seeing how remarkable and beautiful is the person and life of Jesus.
# Community
- listen to some episcopal services of churches in austin. explore more whether lara + i might find a home there. also listen to more vox veniae messages.
- look at how the episcopal church approaches biblical interpretation / inerancy / infallibility
- where is my spiritual home?

# Lara Faith
- Look for a book that helps us focus more on the heart of faith, heart of Christianity, beauty of Christ and helps open the door to an encounter with God.
- look for books about strong female characters in the bible, or strong female christian leaders throughout time. look at junai.
- look for autobiographical examples of people (women) who came to faith later in life, without having a religious background
- Comparing the Jewish and Christian perspective (and getting into the person of Jesus, prophesy

# Personal thoughts to share with Lara on the feminist issue:
- Is she looking for permission to be a feminist and a Christian? You have it. There are plenty of theological arguments that dive deep into the crux of different interpreations. There would be countless PHD thesis written on this subject (complementarianism vs egalitarianism). I think the challenge is that most of this gets really into the weeds and is targetting towards people in the church, because this is where the debate is happening. Christians aren't engaged with skeptics about issues like feminism in many areas. But rather its christians who come from this more conservative viewpoint, bogged down in the institutional christianity that need to hear this. its a battle happening within the faith to shift its attitudes. all the material i have found on these issues are speaking to those in the faith, because thats where the issues are playing out, where the debate is happening.
- I think of the parable about the man who discovered a treasure in a field, and then joyfully went and sold all he had to buy the field. I think the field may have sat next to dump. it may have had a fence around it that was ratty, that had chipped paint. but in light of what treasure in the field, those things didn't mater. should the fence be replaced? yes. can someone point at the fence and say, you ought to repaint that a different color? absolutely. but if you try to understand why this man was so willing to sell everything in order to buy the field, focusing on the ratty old fence would lead you to miss the whole point. so i think your concerns about feminism are really important and should be addressed. but if its possible, i think maybe its worth collecting those questions and then stroing them for later. and then looking to understand the heart of Christianity yourself, and seeing if its compatible. if its a matter of permission...you have permission to bring all of yourself to God. i guess its for that reason that to the question, "is feminism compatible with christiantiy?" I say fuck yeah. its because what ive seen of the character of God, how Jesus treated women, im fully assured that he loves and values women and men equally. the bible says he made both fo them in his image. if thats true, both women and men reflect characteristics of God.
- walk into any church door, and there are going to be different views on how a lot of this ought to play out. there is a lot of diversity. there are not many evangelical churches where you will find female pastors. my granparents church was methodist and had a female pastor. anglican churches, episcolaplian- lots ordain female pastors. and the church is always going to be a flawed institution because its comprised of imperfect people trying to work these things out. ill never find a church where i agree with everything. but i think there is a broad umbrella. and thats not to say it doesn't matter what you beleive, anything goes...but rather that there is enough common ground on the central pillars of faith, that i do feel  that i can find a home...even without agreeing with all of it.
