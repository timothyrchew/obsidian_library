# Chapter 1 
- summary
    - the merits of religion as a basis for explaining not just what human life is, but what human life ought to be (something secularism struggles to answer cohesively).
- Questions / Thoughts
    - regarding the argument that the world is becoming more religious not less religious as a basis for if it is true. popularity is a terrible judge for whether something is true or not, good or bad. if something is entirely niche and fails to gain any traction, then it does call into question its merits. if something gains a lot of traction and strikes a deep chord with people, then it is also worth investigating, but isn't a basis for making a decision on something. 
        - i don't think this holds water, but rather I think its hard to answer the question has religion been a beneficial thing for humanity? I struggle with looking at the current atmosphere in America, and the impact that religion has had here. And there is a very compelling case to make that religion has been a net negative in a tons of ways for the advancement of human societ. Christians and the religious have been on the wrong side of issues more than the right. 
        - is it fair to judge the merits of something by the sum total of the impact it has? how do we judge something that in the right hands unlocks a better state of being, but in the wrong hands opens the door more collective harm due to its ability to be abused and subverted by bad forces?
    - Just because we want something to be true, does not meet that it is true (in response to the Steve Jobs quote). But if there is a shared deep human longing for something that spans across cultures and experiences, perhaps it indicates a design or a way that life ought to be. If I'm hungry, that points to a physical need for food. If I have this deep longing for a transcendent, eternal realtiy, its worth consider that this could be by design.
    - What have been my most powerful encounters of God, the sense of transcendence and fullness that are described here?
        - the moment in HFW village at night, lying in bed after spending the firt evening with grandma on her death bed
        - moments in the hospital during my first brain surgery
        - getting to know "saints" on earth, people in mom and dads orbit with this unexplainable deeply lives marked by sacrifice, peace, fullness that i have not encountered anywhere else
        - confrontations with devastration and unbeleivalbe tragedy (most vicerally even through watching media, news documentaries). this deep sense that this is not how its supposed to be, that there is more to this. and turning to something greater than myself because the natural world provides no sense for it.
        - the beauty in life and art. most recently watching my octopus teacher. moments of awe and amazement at the beauty of the natural world, or a piece of art. the pointers towrads something greater behind all of this. a pointing towrads a higher good, a higher purpose, a higher meaning.
# Chapter 2
- Summary
    - empirical reason can prove neither the claim that there is a supernatural, transcendent reality, nor claim that there is none
- questions to discuss
    - on the statement, "it is wrong always, everywhere and for anyone to beleive anything on insufficient evidence and by sufficient evidence". do you agree with this?
    - how do you feel about the statement that humanistic values are incompatible with a strictly materialistic view of the world?
    - what is the basis by which we ought to approach the notion of God, and determining whether he is real or not? where is evidence important? where does a leap of faith play into that?
    - "all reasoning is based on prior faith commitments to which one did not reason". what are these for you?
        - the universe and life on earth are best explained by a diety that created it
        - our curiosity about god, our natural disposition towrads the concept of god and religions, makes most sense as something that came from a creator who instilled this in humanity. this was put in our "human blueprint" as a reflection of a greater reality
        - life hints that God wants us to know him, and he wants be establish some sort of relationship with us
        - if God wants to be in a relationship, then he will have revealed enough, so that those that want to know Him can find him. that he wouldn't have given us this desire, but then remained abstract enough that it can't be satisfied.
        - God can be bigger than my ability to understand him. it doesn't mean i don't try to understand him, its doesn't mean that i blindly accept everything. instead it is about trying to find the most reasonable, most plausable explanation for things given my intellect, but also acknowledging that there can exist a realm of answers behind the possibility of my mind to comprehent. in a realm outside of time, space, my consciousness, things can make sense and be true that i cannot understand from inside the box. there comes a place where faith in in an unexplanable tension becomes the most reasonalbe stance when taking the entirety into account, and when considering the alternatives.
# Chapter 3
- questions
    - what have you felt like the meaning of your life is?
    - does the fact that we look for meaning, that we desire meaning, make a case for the fact that there is meaning? or is it more likely that meaning is just a pacifier that we create in order to get through the monotony of life? 
# Chapter 4
- questions
    - what do you feel like is what you really want most out of life? what do you feel like is the key to hapiness? do you feel like youve found that happiness? 
    - do you agree with the premise that these things largely dissapoint us and are fleeting? i think the whole premise of the chapter is that these things end up feeling pretty empty. ive personaly always found that the pursuit of something, the looking forward to it, is almost always better than actually achieving it.
- my experiences
    - i have certainly found the notion of mis-ordered loves to be true in my life. whether my career, whether my relationships, i have found time and time again that by trying to get too much out of something (trying to make it my "be all") has let me down again and again. something wasn't right. something wasn't good enough. the pleasures were fleeting and shallow and faded quickly.
    - the alternative that the christian faith proposes, is that we have these really deep desires and hunger, that can't be satisfied or met in finite objects. that in a realtionships with God, through an identity shaped by God, through a pursuit and investment in that, there is a depth and security and building up of an investment that actually does pay dividents, that does delivery on the promises it puts forth. ive tasted enough of this that i do continue to beleive in this.
        - i find this compelling. i find this more promising than any alterntive ive experienced thus far. ny journey was making sense of the dissapoitment, and wrestling with what went wrong. was it me, or was something fundamentally wrong with my faith or my framework for faith. as ive done more exploring, i do feel more convinved that there were aspects of false faith id introduced that were poisoning my faith and my experienes with God. 
# Chapter 5
- summary: why cant i be free to live as I see fit?
# Chapter 6
- summary: the problem of the self
# Chapter 9
- Christianities palpable and remarkable power to transform human life. thinking about the lives of my parents, the way they have lived. thinking about the countless people who work alongside them. Never people you'd see in the news, rarely even the people writing the books. I think this power is incredibly compelling to me.
- I think this notion that I wrestle with is that I don't like God's rules. I like doing it my own way. But I think I've just been feeling more that God has the right to set forth a standard of living, God has the right to tell me how I ought to be living, because of who he is. Even if I don't like it. Even if its inconvenient. 
# Chapter 10
- reflecting on these chapters, i am asking the quesiton if I am agreeing with the points he is making, what does this mean for me? For us?
    - I think that if there is a moral standard, that is outside of ourselves. That is absolute. And we agree that God is in a position to judge. And we agree that it can't necessarily be argued from a position of what feels right, or what doesn't "hurt" others, then it is our duty to then ask how do we know what is right? How must we go about knowing how God wants us to live? And once we begin to from a set of answers about what God might want of us, its time to ask, "Ok will I follow this? Will I choose God or will I take my chances and go my own way?". There is....after some point of genuine exploration...no more room for a middle path. To continue to be indecicive, or to toss off decision, commitment, action...is in itself inherantly a decision to reject God. And to call it anything else is failing to be honest with myself, and failing to be consistent between what I say and what I do.
# Chapter 11
- my thoughts:
    - i think that i find these arguments really compelling and sticky. and coming from a place where i kinda didn't want to be inconvenienced by God, I didn't want to be obligated to God. Yet I found that trying to live in the other framework ended up just really leaving me feeling empty and unhappy. Coming at this fresh has kinda renewed mty conviction that I really do beleive God exists. and so its really asking what does this mean for my life? what does God want of me? both in the big things and the small things? how do i respond to God, how do i live my life in a way that is the best possible investment with the largest ROI.
- questions to discuss:
    - out of these main claims, which ones resonates with you the most? which one do you find the least convinving?
    - so if you feel like you resonated with these points...where does that leave you in terms of God? does it change anything for you or make you more compelled to keep exploring? what do you feel like the next step is?
