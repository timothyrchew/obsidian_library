# Chap 1, A pragmatic philosophy

- Your Knowledge portfolio
	- invest regularly as a habit
	- diversification is key to long term success
	- smart investors balance portfolio between conservative and high risk, high reward investments
	- investors buy low and sell high for maximum returns
	- portfolios should be reviewed and re-balanced regularly


- Goals
	- learn at least one new language every year
	- read a technical book each month
	- read non technical books too. 
		- computers are used by people, i work with people, are employed by people, get hacked by people. dont forget the human side of the equation
	- take classes
	- participate in local user groups and meetups
	- experiment with different environments
		- use linux, use a different IDE, learn about different tools throughout my day
	- stay current
		- read news, posts online about new tech that is different from my current projects. keep track of the broader landscape.

All of this takes time, therefor plan ahead. Always have something to read so that I can take advantage of the small downtimes. Do this instead of defaulting mindless scrollig reddit or listening to pointless podcasts.
