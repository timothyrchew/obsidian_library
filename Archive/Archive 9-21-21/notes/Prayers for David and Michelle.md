I received your email as I was sitting on the porch of a cabin in Montana, looking at this beautiful vista, hearing the rustle of the wind through birch trees, the chearful chirping of birds, with a pit in my stomach and tears in my eyes. 

The same questions that have been so pressing and personal for me come rushing back into my mind. How can the same God who crafted this incredible landscape, and embedded so much of his goodness, his creativity, his precision, his care into it...how can this be the same God who also sits over the unbearable pain and loss and uncertainty that tears through our lives. 

Just like Job I have demanded answers from God, wanting to make sense of my seasons of suffering and wanting to be able to fit it into this box tha made sense and brought meaning, where I was deparate for something more visceral and tangible to hold on to. 

God's response to me has almost never been the kind of simple answer that I've wanted in the moment. But in those times of venting, of being angry, and deep questioning, God has consistentyl and gently opened my eyes to see more of his greatness, his character, his wisdom, and his deep, all consuming love and care for all of us. I have experienced more and more how God doesn't just sit above our pain, but enters into with us in profound ways. 

For me the questions have never gone away, but I have been slowly learning to live in this tension of not having the answers- but finding more of God's heart and character witin the tension and the pain. One of my simple prayers for y'all is that hour by hour, day by day, both of y'all would experience more God's character and would become more assured that he is carrying you through each moment. I don't have much to offer, but if there is anything I can do of course let me know. Praying for ya'll daily.

Love you guys,
Tim
