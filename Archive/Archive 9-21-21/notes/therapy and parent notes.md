my thoughts prior to therapy (written on july 6)
- i would stand up for myself now, i have the confidence in my emotions and my experiences to not get steamrolled by someone who, in the most charitable interpretation, was really misguided and naive.
- im going to be better able to identify that kind of leader
- jonathan going through the same thing was god's gift to truly show me it wasn't just me. this was something larger, a pattern of dysfunction in the way he related and counseled people going through marrital crisis
- the silver lining of this experience and this pain is that im on the other side, not ashsamed of my journey or my experiences. this tornado was instrumental in tearing down the bullshit and helping me start fresh more authentically. it knocked down my pretense and now i am no longer trying to keep up some kind of facade.


gene june 2nd:

- processing the incident with christian
- coming away from this, i think i can see a bit how this experience was part of the tornado that tore though my life and ripped things down. it was destructive and painful. i wouldn't wish it on myself. but now that its happened, i can acknowledge that it helped knock down stuff that was not functioning well. and it was part of helping me tear it all down and start with a fresh clean slate. it has helped me shed the pretense, the games, the notion to maintain some old vesrion of myself in community. its seems counterintuitive- but i feel more able to be myself even though this experience almost ought to serve as something that should reinforce my fears. to genes point- its as though ive been through losing it all. i don't have much to lose at this stage. so it makes sense that i feel more able to engage openly and honestly. i do feel like i kinda feel more free, more able to "let it all hang out", and i can just say fuck it and speak my mind and be myself. the tornado tore down the old me. that old me is gone. and now i am learning to live in this new skin more honestly, more in touch with whats happening inside of me, looking to rebuild and re-engage from this healthier posture.

reflections prior to processing stuff with christian:

- ** the community felt right, it felt like a place we could belong. community ahd been hard. community had been frustrating. it was refreshing to be in a small intimate group. i really looked up to him, i respected his perspective. i respected his blend of entreprenuership and business.
- ** i desparately was looking for someone jenn and i both respected who could mediate and help be an anchor for both fo us.
- ** it was as though the moment the crsis hit, he turned adverserial.
- ** how christians first reaction was to tell me that i had grounds for divorce. and then proceeded to question why i wanted to try to work at things. as though i had to justify my desire to try to restore my marriage in that moment. and what i was looking for was encouragment to keep pressing ahead in the midst of betrayal. i was looking for someone to steady mentor to guide me through this, and to point me in the right direction.
- ** this had become our spiritual home and so i was looking for that healing and support from within those walls.
- ** initially jenn was repentant, but she pretty quickly turned into trying to make the whole thing my fault. why i didn't love her enough, and how her behavior was justified. and in the context of meeting with christian and his wife, there was this distinct turning point where it felt like it felt like her aim was just to drag me through the mud and to get them to view this as my fault. and i can sincerely say i was commited to not falling into that. and when she went on assault, she wrote this 5 page letter to christian that was just this list of every grievance, every fault, every bit of resentment and built this case about why im a terrible husband and why this is my fault. and i refused to fall into that. but i remember meeting with christian after she had sent that letter, and just feelig like stuff had shifted. truly feeling like he had stepped out of my camp. and i just took it on the chin, i knew i had really let her down in a lot of ways and i wanted to change. and i was ok making it about how i wanted to grow and how i wanted to work to make her feel more loved, and how i had made a lot fo mistakes.
- ** he recommended that we separate to focus on ourselves. i didn't really see how this was the right thing when this blew up because of an affair. how introducing more distance would be a good thing. my therapist agreed.
- ** and all the time, im cralwing through all the shit of struggling with jenn. we are going to counseling at the stone. there is some structure there in that session. we actually talk about the affair and her ongoing interactinos with the jeff. but this is moving slowly and im still trying to deal with the day to day of navigating stuff with jenn.
- ** and then i see that she had lied about the extent of the interactins. i meet with christian. im distraught, im looking to share and process this with someone who is involved with both of us. and he tells me this doesn't add up with his sense of where her heart is. and that when he looks at both of us, he sees she has a soft heart and i have a hard hard. and that this video doesn't add up with what she has been telling him and hes more inclined to think she is taking the right steps. I need to stop worrying about her and i need to focus on myself. him saying "i don't know if you actually know jesus". just that being this dagger into my heart, in the middle of me crying out for help and support.
- ** i just took it on the chin. i hindsight maybe he was right. i mean i still think i did know jesus, even though i see clearly know how much i was really struggling spiritual more than i knew. but the overwhelming sense was that my experience, this bearing of my soul, this genuine ask for help, was not valid. that i was being put on trial buy this guy. that i had some hidden agenda in this. i was having to convince him of my experience. i was having to convice him of something objective i had watched, of security footage of jeff spending the night in my bedroom with my wife while i was at my friends bachelor party. i remember tellin ghim thanks for being honest with me, tellin ghim id be taking it to heart. and i remember looking across the table at him- and just seeing this coldness and distance in his face.
- ** That was the last we ever met. He never contacted me again. I heard later on from Jonathan that at some point Jenn had been officially "excommunicated" for not cutting off contact with Jeff. I never heard a word from Christian again.
- ** the hard thing is that i don't even know why he behaved this way. it felt like he had some kind of agenda, that played out with both jonathan and me simultaneously, and i have no idea what it was. it just didn't add up.
- ** this is completely the opposite of what my therapist is saying.

gene may 20th:

- * the sting of the pain from halloween night has been reduced. there isn't any specific epiphany that sticks with me that makes me view that incident as anything other than a painful memory, its never not going to be a painful memory. but its certaintly not as charged as it was, that was one of the takeaways from last time.
- * how do i feel about the statement "i can choose to trust again". im going to have to choose to. there is always a risk. i guess i can say that I don't feel like i am predisposed to having poor judgement when it comes to trying to choose who i can trust. but i have to accep that there is always a chance of getting hurt.
- * sometimes when looking back, im like how could i have been so blind.
- * i think there is just this greater sense of acceptance and making peace with these things as things that were big loses. they will never not be big loses. i will never not be saddened by the fact that my marriage ended and all the destruction that was caused by it in both of our lives.
- ** within that i can also look at what im left with that is good. i feel like my faith is being rebuilt with stronger roots. there is a freedom and a simplicity that comes with being single, that i can just appreciate at this stage in life. and none of those things make the tragedy worth it, or something i would have choosen. but this is the hand ive been dealt, so i can choose to appreciate these things.

gene Feb 24th:

-diggin into memory of events around geralds death

-takeaways:

-i let self-centeredness, judgement get in the way being fully present and fully there for jenn and her mom.

-i want to learn from this....and i think i have grown some in this, by getting better at acceptance and grace and humility in my convictions, allowing for others to be who they are, loving and accepting them. a deeper sense of how flawed and weak i am, and thus more ok with others having their flaws.

-i can see how i used my judgement, my sense of righteous conviction over living a "radical" life for God overseas, as a shield to hide behind my own moral failures, my own faith emptiness, my own doubts and insecurities. and i used it to ahve a sense of superiority over others. i can see now (and my struggles over the past year have shown me) that i am really not that different than gerald was. 

-i want to be more gracious, more humble, allowing for more grey and not needing people to be "in or out". even know as i look for certainty in genesis, i can't let that be a shield to prevent me from asking "what does this book mean for my life, here and today". 

gene jan 20th:

-unpacked ronnie film memory

-biggest takeaways:

-in some sense, having to carry around the gravity of the experience and loss, without being able to share it with others or talk openly about this massive thing in my life resembled and reinforced my mode of relating to community around personal struggles. i was like a church ordained version of that, and maybe it drove a bigger wedge between my pain and true feelings, and my public persona. 

-i think this contributed to my distrust of christian leaders. my fear of submitting to leadership. my cynicism about the church. i trusted them and ronnie was in some way a hero. and he let me down. in being let down- it even made me wonder if ronnie couldn't overome this sexual sin, than what hope did i have. in the middle of struggling and doubting about the power of the gospel to actually change me, this was one more piece of evidence made me doubt i could change.

-on a deep level i doubt that i can be fully functional and healthy in a christian community. all these experiences have piled up evidence that either i am liable to let others down in communtiy (or to revert to my dyfunctions), the leaders will let me down or betray my trust (ronnie and christian), or christian community is just not for me and i am better off doing this alone.

mom and dad talk dec 20:

-we are not looking for religion, we are looking at who is god. 

-hebrews 11 "without fiath it is impossible to please god". getting into the issue of focusing on religious, dealing with the problematic, hard parts. at the core, we need to take the step of faith, but there are things we wont understand. things we don't fully understand, or like. but god can't be confined to a box. 

-its a dangeous place to be in the posture of judging God, fitting him into my box. in the end God asks us to lay down our rights, he doesn't promise that we will get all our rights. 

-the centerpiece of fiath is that he sent a baby, sent himself to live amoungst us, to pave a path for us to know him. he didn't give us a complete guidebook. he gave us the holy spirit. thats the core, and with the bible we have to piece things together, its not an instruction book. jesus himself taught in parables (rather than just saying it outright). the other passages are really just a small percentage. similiarly paul wrote a ton about love, self sacrifice, laying down your life, community.

-it makes sense to start with the basic, how to love god, how to be humble, how to have a correct approach to God, how to see the truth about yourself. once you understand these core things, the other things begina to fall into place. they don't really matter as much (mom and dad have all female leaders in their org, these issues have never once become an issue or tension point).

talk to mom and dad nov 21:

-talking about process vs outcomes. ive got to bring god into this. relaizing that each day, hes given me a set of parameters that i can't control. i ahve my own goals, but they are foolish apart from god. and i can rest that god has giving my constraints today, and so its a matter of doing what God owuld like today, not about just my own goal.

-maybe instead of process vs outcomes, its about relationship vs outcomes. framing things in the terms of a relationship with god, vs trying to achieve goals. thinking about the relational aspect, trying to grow my relationship with God in all these things.

-giving God the authority to decide what i will get done today based on what comes at me today. being ok with letting go of those things as things change.

-"Lord Jesus, I offer myself to you today. Let me be a vessel filled with your truth, love, and power. I lay down my agenda to be available for your work. I lay down my ideas to be led by your Spirit. I lay down my sin to be filled with your holiness."

talk with gene nov 17th:

-discussing moment of seeing jenn's spotify activity and then finding jeffs account, his last name, finding his address is officially at my old house.

-lying in bed, crying, and telling God "I'm done playing games, I want to dig in. I want to deal with this. I want to move forward. I want to get serious about this."

-diving into my struggles with feeling constantly let down by my failure to acheive the goals, failure to actually change, failure to move forward in a consistent way. feeling stuck and like im wasting my life and my potential.

-i need to reframe to think about the process rather than the outcomes. being faithful in engaging with the process, and leaving the outcomes up to god. the idea of "no zero days", doesn't matter the outcome or quantity, but always try to take at least a small step each day.

-digging into my brain surgery memory, looking at it as a case study of expecting big chagne, life change from such a seizmic event, yet again not getting the change i wanted and falling into self-loathing, dissapointment, and defeat when normalcy and old habits creep back in, apathy sets in.

- asking God how do i get past the self defeatest talk? how do i have confidence in the possibility of lasting change and lasting growth? how do i really engage with him in the process over the outcome? how is "confidence in god and not in myself" move beyond and empty platitude into something real to me?
- maybe one way is to to embrace "radical honesty" with God in the process. to bring it all to him moment by moment, hour by hour, day by day. to be unfiltered, uncensored as i struggle, as i want to give up. to be more mindful with him, more aware of my thoughts, more aware of whats happening in me, more in touch. and to try to bring it all to him as a friend, as a confidant, as a coach, as a father. telling him when i want to give up, when it doesnt feel worth it, when i feel hopeless.
- embracing process (system) over the outcome. planning for failure. planning for lapses. planning to fall, but committing to getting back up again.
- thinking about friends of mine who are tremendously focused and disciplined and high acheiving, seemingly without needing God for this. and feeling discouraged in myself that i can't be like that, in some sense feeling discouraged that I need God's help to just function on a basic level here. How this does show me how much pride and self-reliance i have. How I don't want to let go of the steering wheel, how I want to be autonomous, how I want to feel in control of the path ahead of me. How I don't really want to give that up to him.
- its absolutely critical that i humble myself, and address the root of this self-reliance, this pride, this grip on control. that i pry that out of this process, in a way that would open up the space for to engage with God, to give him the room to work instead of keeping my hands on the wheel but asking him to drive.
- reflecting on how in the past, i always felt like spritiual highs were the result of circumstances (largely around trauma or my health crisis). and how i really wanted this season to be a story of me choosing to walk towards god with consistent steps. that intention, of not wanting a faith that only comes alive in crisis or the right circumstances is a good one, but buried in that is also this toxic and unehalthyu self-dependence and pride and desire to be in control, a desire to engage on my own terms. i need to decouple these things, i need to get to the root of that pride and maintaining control and doing it just on my own terms. i need to be willing to truly surrender, to truly make space for god.

talk with gene sep 15th:

-being angry about hearing bekah say they probably would have just given up on india if they stayed 24 hours later. angry about missing this time with zeke.

-talking about the dissapointment of the anita film. the loss associated with that, how jeremy and I shared that. talked about the conversation Im going to have with jeremy, what that meant to me, what im hoping to accomplish by connecting with him now.

-EMDR on memory of leaving my grandparents place. that was the place of normalcy. normal grandparents, normal house, normal space, fun things to do. being upset that there hasn't really been normalcy in our family since then. nobody has a normal house. resenting how frugal mom and dad have been, choosing the more extreme aspect of frugality which meant the pain points of being a missionary were more exaggerated than it felt like they had to be. we could have had a place in the states. we could have reduced how complicated everything has to be. 

     -also it was more painful because I felt like I was the main one mourning it. That’s why I was surprised to hear it was that hard in Daniel as well. But I did feel pretty alone at that time and I did not feel safe or comfortable expressin

-but acknowledging that its selfish on my part, and that i still woudl always choose for them to live their lives the way that bring them the most fullfillment and meaning. so maybe its more anger at God about these circumstances. I just long for something with family to be easy. I long for proximity. I long for casual trips across town to get together as a bigger family. I long for family holidays. 

-also remembering my time in michigan, reveling at how small i am in the face of the god of the universe and the scale of what he has created. who am i to question him. but i want to bring that pain, bring that anger to him. i don't want to let it fester or bury it. he can handle it. learning to hold the truth that he is bigger, but also still bringing my loss and anger to him. not writing it off because of a cognitive truth but asking him for help with it. 

talk with mom and dad, september 13th:

-spiritual warfare is an aspect, its not just about me and God.

-the enemy is trying to distract, trying to keep me dissapointed, discouraged.

-ask god to help me recognize these forces at play in my life. ask God to help me be alert to that reality.

-ask God how can i start fresh reading the bible through new eyes. ask God that i could open up scripture and read it as though it is the first time

-start listening to the gospels from "the message" translation while i work out

-try to go back to the gospels, and try to read it as though im seeing, meeting him for the first time.

talk with mom and dad Sep 7th:

-need to talk to jeremy. be honest with him about missing his relationship, feeling pain there. also letting him down and not being ther for him. telling him that i let him down as well. make sure to talk about the condition of the relationship and how important it is to me.

-focusing on existing relationships, talking each of them one more step towards vulnerability and transparency. be intentional about revealing a little bit more of myself to each of them. 

-could consider reach out to matt from christ church

-think more about persevearance, and how maybe i have shown more than i think i have. but its a matter of doing better, more realistic goal setting. and expecting ups and downs. 

-i need to ask lara more questions about her soul. if i find it difficult emotionally to share my soul with her, i might have some repreive asking her more deep questions about her soul. nuture my own desire to know whats going on inside of her. it will be especially so if its one way, if nots not balanced.

talk with mom and dad 8/30:

```jsx
Wounds --> Lament ---> Forgiveness
Guilt --->  Confession/Repentance ---> Receive Forgiveness

Feeling like I may have garbled up that idea when I talked about it.  
They are two separate processes.  
I think you need to walk down both, need God's wisdom for what components are in which category.  ❤️
```

-im still in this lake of sorrow and pain. im not at the shore yet. its important that i keep stirring it up, and taking it to god repeatedly through lament.

-need to tap into the emotions of how ive hurt jenn, how i have wronged her, my sadness of those emotions. whenever i get handles on speicifc ones, it is probably time to write a lament again.

-on one part im made at god, but im also struggling with personal responsibility guilt over my contributions, my past behavior

-maybe its less about forgiving jenn (or looking externally), but more about being able to forgive myself in that relationship about my contributions

-ask God to understand a new part of his character or nature

thoughts after talking to mom 8/24:  

(next step of for understanding gmc season: ive made more sense of how i felt, and how i responded. rather than even trying to ask what does it say about how i view god, maybe i should be trying to better know myself. do i really know myself? what can i learn about myself from that experience?)

-remember God's words to me, "come meet me in your pain, I'm waiting for you here". need to take a break with the kitchen safe. and need to go meet God there.

-second to this: i MUST start digging in spiritually with lara. talking to her. getting to know her more. sharing more of myself. finding the actual tension points as i move towards God. don't let the hypothetical stop me, both in terms of moving towards God, or my pre-conceived notion of how she might respond or how she could grow.

notes from counseling 8/18:

-seeing that example as a case study as to why i that mode of living, relating to others, hiding, is a miserable way to live. and how it didn't have to be that way, there is an alternate.

-appreciating how much jesse and eriks honestly and lack of pretense, made me feel safe and open with them as well. how much better that was than other ones, and how that in turn had a multiplicative effect, and impacted me as well

-considering how at ease, safe, and life giving those kinds of relationships can be. when its not based on performance, its not based on apperance, but its based on vulnerability and being open and honest and caring about one another

-how i want to try to live with my sense of worth, my sense of identity, detached from how others respond to me. how their response doesn' thave to dictate the way that i feel about myself or view myself or get my worth.

-how misplaced my focus is when im more concerned about how i appear and what i project, than who i actually am. the life i am actually living, the choices that i am actively making.

-should start with connecting with brett. really opening up to him, really tearing down that wall and aiming for true oopenness.

talk with parents aug 12th (from chapter 5): 

(look at warddles 3 steps to tackle root bitterness)

-focusing on being very open and honest about myself

-need to keep praying that god will reveal these things to me, that he's show me where it affecting me

-think through what i need to repent of, what do i need to renounce

-the importance of learning to be open and full honest with where im at, what im struggling with

-make it a concrete goal of intentionally connecting with people from my past, old friends. and being totally hoenst and transparent, practicing this new approach. opening up with them about how im struggling, where im at. learning to be honest and open.

things to consider from chat with mom and dad july 10th:

-focus on pride, focus on my posture before god. these things are at the heart and probably are where i need to wrestle with God most significantly. ask him to show me how my pride is manifesting itself. think about what humility would look like right n ow. think about how i could try to embrace humility with God this next week, asking him for his help to change me in ways that I have no ability on my own.

-i also really need to see God as good. ask him to show me how he is good. but also think about ways that I might not be letting myself see God as good. think about how i would want to see that God is good and if those are actually good measures.

(thinking about the terrible feeling of regret and harnessing this to make changes)

Things I know I will deeply regret if I don't invest in now

-prioritizing spiritual growth and taking steps towards where i need to go

-investing in friendships and being honest and true in my relationships: with long time friends, new friends, lara

-using this important season to invest deeply in my career growth and taking the next step professionally.

Things I will never regret:

-Not spending more time playing videos games

-Not spending more time stoned, vegging out in front of a screen

notes from parents july 6:

-two things to ask God.

-that he would show the difference between the fiath i was tryign t live, legalistic and performative. and that he would show me how that is different from true faith.

-also that he would show me how i got on that track. that he would help me to remember things even from my childhood that shaped that concept of God or distorted it. 

-ask God to show me where my posture might be wrong today. ask him to show me ways that I might be unwilling to let myself meet him or encounter him. or if I am already holding back or unwilling to surrender, why would he show himself to me?

-I need to be real that there will be a time of decision, that requires full and earnest surrender, setting aside my way, and following after God's way. I can't let myself slip into this mode of thinking that I can continue in this stage of straddling- exploring while also still staying in control of what i want to control, without having to come to a cross-roads where I do take up my cross and die to myself. but in the context of a real encounter with God this is nothing to be scared of this, this is the man who joyfully sold all his possessions to purchase the field with the treasure because it was worth so much. One way to pray when I feel nervous and repelled by this, is to ask God to show me the value of the treasure, and to help me to get glimpses of what it is like, whats lies ahead for me in this path. I don't need to know all of it, but I can at least ask him to show me some of it. 




# Oct 20th 2021
- EMDR on the step study and looking at porn right after
- The realization that I was really much more bothered at the notion of having to confess that I messed up and how it would make me look, than I was about the act itself
    - I was very outcomes focused and performative in the way I approached growth in spiruituality, I'm not sure I was really actually wanting to change my heart
    - If you had told me I could change the rules of Christinity to make porn permissible, I would have accepted that because fundamentally I didn't really want to change. I actually really like behavior I was trying to get rid of
    - Because I didn't really want to change, my invovlement in step studies, in fighting the sin...was one that was very much rooted in obligation. I didn't really want to do it but I woudl force myself to at least do enough that I could alleviate my concience and also look like I was doing well.
- This comes back to the question of how does a heart change? In the sliding scale of our effort vs God's mysterious work, where does the transformation and movement out of sin happen? What does it look like to not take the white knuckle, will powered approach?
- What if isntead of being focused on the outcome (stopping the sin / legalism), this should istead be about focusing on the process itself, and meeting and engaging with God in the weakness.  
    - What if its not actually about reaching some goal (stopping the sin) or some sort of legalistic outlet, but these struggles are actually a valuable opportunity to humble ourselves before God, admit we can't do this life without him, we need his help, and then to just meet him in that. To seek to experience him in this, to ask him into this, and to focus on knowing God better in the midst of the struggle. What if the particular outcome isnt' particularly important at all, but rather the goal is embrace our weakness, to humble ourselves, and to learn to submit to and to rely on God in a more real way.
    - What if the pressure to stop sin, or acheive some goal isn't meant to be on our shouler. What if as a beleiver, the work on the cross allevaites that for us, and instead we can see our weakness and our failings as a valuable opportunity to know and encounter God in a more real way. 
- When I look back, I feel like I have always been sitting on the fence. I have always approach my faith as something I wanted to control. I wanted to have God in a box, where I could alleviate my conscience, feel like I was going to heaven, fit into communtiy, but I wanted it on my terms. And part of those terms where not having to go to extreme measures to cut out sin (because frankly I didn't want to give it up.
    - How does my heart fundamentally change to where I want God and I want to give up everythying that gets in the way of him? What should I actually feel? What do I need to muster, and what part is up to God?
