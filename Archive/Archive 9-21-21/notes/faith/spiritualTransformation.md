# How do I change?
- I'm scared. I hate the uncertainty of this process. I feel like I should be able to just jump in, to put it all on the table in front of you, and to get after it- to stop being a hypocrite, to stop sitting on the fence.
- But here I am. I feel paralized. I feel scared that if I give this a real shot, and then fail again, feel the familiar feelings from my prior season of faith, that it will cause me to feel even more discouraged and to have even more questions. I'm scared to put it to the test. It's nicer to keep it as a hypothetical that MIGHT be different and more real, than to try it and to feel difinitely that nothing has changed and that its just he same.
- God help me to find a resource, some material, a framework that helps give me a sense of clarity and tactics, while not ending up in a place of legalism and white knuckling and repeating my old habits. Please show me how I ought to structure me life towards these goals in ways that I can latch onto.
- Lord have mercy on me. I confess that I am so full of sin, so full of rebellion, so unworthy of approaching you. Help me in my weakness, help me with my fear, help me with my questions. I want to change to be the man you want me to be. Lead me to the next step.
