First interview was a technical screen
- exercise was build a quck search box that would search books from a google open api and display the results (title, author) with pagination
- didnt have to worry about styling


how it went
- he said don't worry about styling, but do worry about components structure
	- i rushed so much that i did zero formatting in the title, authors, even though i could have taken 60 seconds and at least used basic components
	- i didn't even break out a single component even though i could easily broken out the books and pagination into component
- i didn't take his prompt about pagination and using the api for pagination. my original approach about paginating entirely on the frontend was stupid
- i didn't carelly handle null checks or test my code- he had to bring up the edge cases one by one.
- my blunders
	- i started rushing and getting frantic, rather than slowing down and being methodical. i start rushing to super brute force, happy path implementations. i start getting ok with really shitty approaches because i started panicing.
- i let myself get very nervous and a bit flustered as i went on, to where i wasn't thinking with my full brain.
- i overprepared from some more complex type of application, while i would have been better off just practicing some fundamentals and not getting too fancy with it

Second technical react exam:
- i was given a fairly simple UI mock (of a mobile view) and then asked to build it.
- i was able to make it through pretty far and they seemed impressed. Nothing too crazy, just some positining and flex box. The one slightly tricky part was figuring out how to render a dollar amount that was styled uniquely with the dollar amount being big and the cent amount being small and aligned differently. had to convert number to string and split by the ".".
- I think i did a good job of calling out some compromises as I was going, saying what I would do if I had more time but acknowledging I was taking some shortcuts for the sake of time.

Systems desing interview:
- it ended up not being a backend design as I expected but entirely a frontend design exercise. I was given a short paragraph that described an app with Burittos, a loyatly credit card program, burrito coin rewards (based on blockchain). And then I was asked to treat the API as a black box, but to build out how I would approach designing the frontend.

I struggled, given I had really never done this type of diagram for the frontend, and have not seen any good examples of this (I got asked a similiar question for OJO and also really struggled).

The interviewer was very friendly and helped steer me. We drew out the simple interface, and began labeling what components. We talked about where to store data (local vs global), what API endpoints to fetch, what components to build. But we stayed quite high level and I know I didn't do a good job and really fleshing things out because I was quite unsure of how to do this (take a systems desing approach to frontend app).

Takeaway is that I really need to practice this and come up with an approach for diagraming and comunicating how I would structure and build a frontend app. How to articulate this on a whiteboard. Talking about key components, data models and flow, API interfaces, components methods, props, etc. I cant find any good models of this currently so I will need to practice and develop my own techinque. I have all the knowledge and good ideas, I just need to come up with an approach to communicate this at a high level through a whiteboard.
