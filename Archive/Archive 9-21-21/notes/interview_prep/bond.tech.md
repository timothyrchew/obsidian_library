# My intro

It is great to meet you. My name is Tim, I'm currently based in Austin, TX. Ive been working as dev for little over 5 years. This is my second career, previously worked in the film industry. Spent 7 years in that world, as a cinematographer and then director / producer. SinceOn the tech side, spent time at a couple different tech startup- ranging from being the first engineering hire at techstars startup where i was involved in building out and leading that team, to currently working at a Series A startup. ive been in my current role at Yonder for just over 2 years on the product engineering team. My role has been as a full stack dev, although my focus has been skewed more towards the frontend of the stack. 


what im looking for:
- strong eng team
	- emphasis on code quality, precision, reliability. there is always a tradeoff between moving really quick, taking on a lot of tech debt. and building things that are scalable and resiliant and polished. most of the teams ive worked on so far have skewed much more towards building really quickly in the process of finding product/market fit. and there is a lot to be learned in that approach. however i will say that im looking for a team and company at that stage where there is a focus and value placed polish, UX, reliability. specifically one of the things about fintech that is attractive is that nature of the work. there is an elevated bar for the way that things need to work to instill that confidence and earn that trust. im really excited to work.
- looking for a product that has traction and a bright future. ive stayed in startups because i love the sense of owernship that comes with getting to grow with a product. and so its tremendously important that i beleive in the product, that i feel bought into mission of the company. im going to work really hard, im going to be bought in. so its critically important that the core belief is there, that i genuinely resonate with product and the vision.
- the people. its sounds cliche. collaboration and relationships have been a big part of what have made past opportunities really rewarding and enjoyable. so i am looking for an enviornment where there is high value placed on transparency, where there is a shared passion about what everyone is collectively buidling, and where there is cross pollenation and knowledge sharing and healthy collaboration cross functionally. 
- so these are some of the things that in my 1-1 engagements during the interview process, as well as talking to nick- ive really worked to get a sense for.


their business model
- there is a stickiness when implementing a third party financial service as part of your offering. ive used stripe for payment processing in the past, and because it works well, its incredibly sticky. and i love the idea revenue and success being tied very directly to how well your clients are doing. rising tide that lifts all ships. 
- its a substantial problem to tackle with a ton of opportunity for different offerrings within the fintech space. i dont know this, but i have to imagine that you all have aspirations to branch out. so you are just sitting at a really exciting stage where it would be a lot of fun to get into the trenches with you.


where id like to take my career:
- in the immediate future im looking to optimize for growth, both in terms of technical growth and leadership:
	- both from technical standpoint- 
- in the future id like to be in engineering leadership
	- right now i continue to be focused on looking for opportunities to step up and take ownership, looking for ways to contribute to engineering culture- not in any perscriptive sense- but from a place of understanding where the team is now...and where they are looking to go, and seeing how i can be a catalyst for that.

# Behavioral summary

overview of conflict / disagreement case studies:
- taking over the curation project after james dropped the ball on the summary report work. dealing with the tension and finding a healthy collaborative dynamic.
- using template / react hybrid. avoiding the true SPA paradigm for our curation tool.
 - dissagrements with product about how to support exporting a PDF of the daily digest

leadership outside of tech:
- picked to participate in a team of 4 people plus our CEO and COO to design a plan for strucuting and rolling out a squad model
	- things we worked on:
		- how squads would be organized
		- process for submitting new squad ideas
		- how to maintain alignment
		- how to manage communication between squads
	- i acted as a squad leader
- running company demos. getting more comfortable doing these in front of the company, being asked by our CTO to do them.
- creating documentation, and training our CS folks how to use our tool

moments of failure:
- the email version of the curation view. overcomitting to what we could do in the emails. i was not skeptical enough of my original solution, given i had not worked extensively with html / css in emails before. i made more assumtions about what was possible after testing some things in gmail and apple mail. i didn't vett thigns enough across different clients / OS. i was guilty of wanting to discover that we could support this type of navigation in email. i feel prey to my own biases. (lesson of learning to doubt myself more.)

decision making:
- curation tool- lots of tradeoffs when considering UI / UX
	- collected a bunch of feedback. much of it at odds with one another. had to parse, contextualize it, and distill it into actionable feedback.
	- examples of tradeoffs:
		- WYSIWYG editing vs sidebar editing
		- guided wizard vs flexible, open ended structure
- convo import / export
	- using more common structure formats -> easier to convert that into our custom query format, but much less intuitive and seamless for non-technical users to work with.
	- supporting boolean query- high dev cost, more hurddles, but moves us towrads a more common format with broader support.
- charting libraries
	- high level (chartsjs. gives you nice prebuilt components. much easier to implement, but less customizable) vs low level (visx, react d3 wrapper)

personal strength:
- with my background in the creative industry, an attention to visual detail. and obsession with how the end user interacts with a user interface, and how to optimize that and how to make that a delightful experience. and some of that attention to detail was honed looking through the lense of a camera, making sure its framed just perfectly, shifting a plant 2 inches to the right, making sure the light is reflecting just right off a bounce board. i bring this attention to detail to code, but also in the way i think about what we are building, and how to keep the end users experience in the front and center
- collaboration and team synergy is really important to me.

personal weaknesses / or an area im looking to grow in:
- balancing a growing sense of confidence in my abilities, while also still skeptical of my instincts, interrogating them, and not letting myself jump too quickly to a solution just because ive seen success with this in past. 
	- the concept of the "killing zone", you are the most dangerous pilot between 100-200 hours. thats when you get past the initial stage of questioning all your abilities and being very conservative. and you begin to develop confidence, but you still don't have the depth of experience to account for all the variables- so a false confidence is the most dangerous thing. 
	- im at the stage where ive owned and shipped some big features and ive developed a lot more confidence than when i getting started. ive also continuing to develop an awareness about how easy it is to be over confident about estimations.
	- this happened with the email implementation 

what im looking for:
- opportunities for growth and ownership. this continues to be the most important thing for me. my current role has been really gratifying when its comes to getting to own and lead some high impract feature work, while collaborating across the entire team cross-functionally. but i think the nature of the company has meant that we have often been spread thin, wearing a lot of hats, and its come at the cost of getting to really go deeper into the tech.
	- im really looking for a strong technical engineering culture, where i can really stretch myself, expand my skills, and continue learning from other really smart, experienced engineers.
- the people. this one is simple. i really value good relationships and a collaborative environment. especially given we are remote, the collaborative culture is very important. the best jobs for me have almost always been great because of the people i worked alongside and the relationship built there. so im looking for a collaborative culture. and looking for hungry, smart, humble people.
- lastly i got into tech because i love building products and taking pride in my work. so its really important to me that i beleive in the product and get to work alongside people that take pride in their work and really share a collective sense of ownership and proximity to the product. this is why ive gravitated towards startups in my career so far, and that sense of ownership continues to be an important thing for me.

# Salary

When we first began this conversation, I had been thinking that I would begin starting to explore some new opporunities and starting to look over the next couple months. But I do have the luxury of being a good situation, where I am not in a rush and I can take the time to make sure that this next move is going to maximize this opportunity. 

So the number I had in mind was 180 - 200. With that said there is some flexibility

So I'm looking for an opportunity 



# My current considerations

frontend role considerations:
- while i could be vehement about doing backend at yonder- the majority of my work will be frontend still. but i could make it a true fullstack role
- i got the sense that i could pick up some backend work at bond once i get comfortable and contributing at a good level on the frotnend
- i can always continue to study and learn the generalist skills to pass generalist interviews
- i can always switch back to fullstack roles moving forward, i wont become pidgeonholed unless i let myself.

ultimately, if i want to go to big tech- the interviews are going to be for generalists. ill have to study hard even if i get more hands on backend dev experience now. going into a true frontend role wont preclude me from going to faang.

perhaps the best thing for me, is to get out of nk now, so i stop spinning my wheels unproductively here, and to focus on getting to the best place i can based on short terms prep (max 1 month). and for this next place- look for comp growth and good work-life balance. then when settled into this next place, establish a longer term, but still rigourous prep plan for true FAANG. then look to gun for the next level in about a 9-12 months when i can realisitcally get to that level without killing myself in the next 6 months.
