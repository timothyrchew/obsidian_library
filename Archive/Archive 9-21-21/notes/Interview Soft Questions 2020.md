**What are the three things most important to me in a job (Culture aspects that are important to me)?**

- really the first thing i look at in **new opportunities is how much I can grow** and challenge myself in the role. for me that means a looking for a collective culture of learning and growth, that means an opportunity to continue to maximize my growth technically, but also growing as a leader. ideally id like to see a company that does promote from within, and id like to see a path into a management role in the future.

- **the people**. im very relational and collaborative, so the people I work with are incredibly important. looking for hungry, humble, smart. the best jobs ive been in have been because of the realtionships and collaboration, so this is incredibly important.

- **looking for a chance to shape the product**. im come from a creative background and the reason ive choosen this career path is because im passionate about building and growing products. the ideal role for me is one where engineering feels a sense of ownerhsip for the product and has a seat at the table for discussions around product roadmap.

—

**Personal overview:**

- have taken a non- traditional path into software engineering.

- i went to film school and UT and spent a number of years traveling around the world as Cinematographer

- and then founded and grew a full service film production company, where I was focused a lot more assembling and leading creative teams to develop and execute on film concepts for our clients.

- we ended up getting acquired by a larger agency looking to jumpstart their own in house team and portfolio, so i took that chance to pivot into a another passion of mine. took that chance to negotiate my way out.

- id done some coding on the side as a hobby and longtime interest, i built our website and a couple small things on the side. the biggest drive in my transition was very much a creative drive to solve big problems with scalable solutions.

- combining my creative entreprenurial bent with my experience building and leading creative teams-  and now looking build out my technical skills.

- went to Galvanize in 2016, 6 months intensive program.

- since then have worked my way through three different startups, from being the first engineering hire at a super early stage tech stars startup, to now closing in on a year at a growth stage startup

- happy to touch on any of those experiences in more depth. in short ive got a history of asembling and leading creative teams that spans back to my days as a director producer in the film world. ive found that experience has translated really well to the tech world. i was the lead engineer at tech stars startup and managed a small team there. i think the overarching theme has been really trying to optimize for technical growth.

- right now im closing in on a year at yonder. when i joined this company i was very much looking for a growth stage startup and the chance to learn within a slightly bigger engineering organization, when i joined the company was approaching 70. trying to be a sponger around more senior devs. my favorite part has been getting to really get my hands dirty in the interative process of refining product market fit around a problem im really passionate about. and its been a nice change of pace from from the really early stage startup. having the resources to think a little more long term in the way we build things. getting to move across a pretty board tech stack. and also getting to lead development on a couple new features as a squad lead (based on the spotify squad model).

- In all honestly, I haven't been actively looking for new opportunities. but I have started feeling a bit of that itch to get back into excitement and intensity of an early stage starteup, particuarly the comraderie of getting in the trenches alongside. that edge, that highly engaged team, is something that i have missed at yonder. even though it is a startup its a pretty cushy job and there is some of that complacency that can come with that within our engineering culture.

- so when taylor reached out, definitely peaked my interesest. we've worked together very cloesly over the years and knowing the collaborative chemistry we have, along side the many good things he's shared about the rest fo the team definitely led me to want to engage and learn more.

Specific Company Highlights:

- Joined Photomadic where I loved getting to really sink my teeth into a fairly broad code base, multiple apps, including front end, API, and two mobile apps. Getting to work closely with CEO and Director of Engineering to own aspects of the product evolution and development. Loved my time there. After a series of funding troulbes we went from a team of 15 down to 4. And then 6 months later the remainder of us were laid off.

- From there joined Locus Insights. was hired alongside 2 other engineers as the first hires as a platform engineer. Team of 6 with 4 engineers. Within about the first month on it became clear there was a leadership vacuum, and the founders decided to formally move me into the lead engineer role where I was responsible helping them develop and architect the product from just a concept, through to launching our MVP about 5 months later. I loved the team and the product (and i still beleive it would have been a success with more time), but sadly we faced the issue of not raising enough money and the entire team was layed off before we were able to really give the platform a good chance. I'm really proud of what we built and delivered during that time, despite being a much shorter run than I had hoped, I learned a ton and would have absolutely done it again.

- Closing in on a year at Yonder. Looking for that opportunity was looking for a growth stage startup with a bit more structure and senior engineers to learn from. Its been great to learn alongside a larger team. When I joined the company was approaching 70. We've been tackling a fascinating and important problem. Getting to iterate quickly on a new product, getting to work alongside some really interesting data science. Getting to have ownership as a squad lead, shaping that process of working.

**why i switched from film to engineering:**

- accomplished a lot what i set out to do in film. got to film on 5 continents. worked with amazing clients. started a successful film company. working on a feature film im very proud of.

- tech to improve live and tackle issues of inequality in the world. working with refugees through job training and connections.

- much more driven in product development + engineering that creative service. enjoy the process of crafting scalable solutions to problems, after a while talking about problems, i actually want to be part of the solution.

What I've done at Yonder:

- Joined at a really interesting stage. The company has build an impressive client list and fairly mature revenue with a team of analyst, customer success memeber using a suite of our proprietary internal tools. And I joined right in the build up to launching a client facing platform, that would put our tools into our clients hands in a way that would allow us to migrate away fromt he white- glove approach and mroe towards a scalable platform.

- So Ive been very much in the trenches of figuring out how translate our unqiue insights and approach that we've devepoed with incredible data science team, and how we put that in a product.

- Was one 3 people working with our CEO / COO working to roll out the cross- functional squad model.

- I've acted as a team lead through a couple of these sprints. Focus on giving a global view of emerging topics and narratives, highlight anomolies in emerging data, and allowing customers to drill in. up to this point, id describe the tool as being like looking through a telescope. It was really good drilling down when you knew what you were looking for, but not great stepping back and evaluating the full landscape, and understanding how these different microcosm fit within in the boarder context.

- In the last two months, our engineering team has gone through some big transitions. We did have a round of layoofs related to COVID. And we are small enough that we are operating as single team wokring from unified KANBAN backlog.

- Biggest challenges or accomplishments:

- getting in the weeds, understanding customer problems, and truly being set free to prototype and launch features with cleints. running a design sprint and implementing a solution, and getting this infront of customers. getting to lead this entire process. got to spend a fair amount of time infront of the company giving updates, presenting our prototypes. definitely getting more comfortable at larger scale demos than I have in the past.

- our codebases are the product of several pivots, pretty high fragmentation, not a lot of standards.

- working with frontend team to re- architect the React app, brining it up to speed with more recent best practices. Moving to React hooks. Getting rid of a very bloated Redux state management system. Using shared components / wrappers to handle loading states, error or no data messages. Shedding some bloated third party libraries we had been using for layouts, rolling our own more minimal solution.

- working with a backend team to rethink our API structure, how to improve performance. utilizing some of the opportunities like caching pre- calculated json blobs. we were calulating a lot of metrics and datasets on the fly, despite that fact that our ingest pipeline and ML job generally run hourly. Harnessing this and generating json blobs hourly. Matching routes to widgets in a 1:1 way that allowed for caching, and async prototping.

What I did at Locus:

- when I joined the team, I was brought on with one other engineer. At that point our technical founder had been focused on developing the eye tracking tech for seveveral years, but had never built a platform or dealt with web technologies. They had some rough mockups but no product at that time.

- (R&D) So early in the process we spent a lot of time meeting with SMEs, traveling onsite to meet with companies like Facebook, Homeaway, Indeed an learning more about their UI / UX process.

- From there we began building and testing a couple prototypes architectuing our MVP.

- And finally the last 4 months ahve been spent building and luanching our early access MVP.

- (ARCHITECTURE)I was incharge of architecting and leading out platform engineering, and integrating the eye tracking tech into our platform.

- (BEST PRACTICES) Set up our git workflow, setup our styleguide, set up our CI/CD pipline with Travis

- (MENTORING) I've benefitted a lot from this. I really enjoy teaching and take seriously my responsibility to help more juniors on my team.

- (MANAGING) I ran our sprints and daily engineering checkings. I managed our engineering roadmap.

- - - 

**Missed timeline and how I handled it:**

- communicating with clients while they were waiting for urgent issues to get fixed. also working with elements of the codebase I hadn’t working with before. example is diagnosing the fixing the SMS issue with twilio delivering MMS to germany. APPROACH - > Communicate early. Take responsibility. Provide insight if desired. Be resourceful meeting your commitment to the best of my ability.

- let them know as soon as it becomes evident that I will not have the issue solved for them in time. work my hardest to get there, in this case working after hours, utilizing all the resources I can, including reaching out to customer support as to why we aren’t seeing the attempts even show up in our logs.

- cerego project. it involved working with our clients key customers, to produce little vignettes. in this case we had a delivery date, but were struggling to nail down our subjects and locations. were waiting on factors outside of my control. keeping an open line of communication as much as they want. let them know I can keep them in the loop as much as they want, but that I also don’t want to overload them of drag them into more of it than they want. being persistent to following up with our outside contacts. asking what we can do to step in and help move the conversations forward, make phone calls, provide more detail.

- BBE freelance development. subcontracted a friend of mine. was counting on his availability. he had life happen and so i had to go back to client client and let them know we were going to be late. working with him to help tackle some of the additional work as much as I could.

**Doing something outside of comfort area (demonstrate ADAPTABILITY), or greatest tech challenge I faced:**

- (USING ELECTRON)at Locus, I had never built a desktop app. During the our R&D phase, testing different approaches to some tough technical challenges, it soon became clear that moving our app out of the browser and into a desktop App was going to give us the opporutniy in terms of delivering value for our customers. I was losely familiar with Electron from a conceptual standpoint, and its great for JS developers because the UI and app logic are coded pretty much just as you would for the web. But it did bring a new set of challenges, things like handling code signing, handling app updates (and implementing an mechanism for over- the- air udpates), a new app lifecycle hooks and the electron ecosystem. I actually love diving into new tech and this development step came with lots of learning but I enjoyed it.

- (taking over lead engineer role at Photomadic)last couple weeks before Photomadic let go of the entire team, i stepped in the lead engineer. diagnosing customer issues as the lead developer, working with unfamiliar parts of the codebase. BLUETOOTH ISSUE with lighting array losing connection. my approach has been to work as clearly as I can to identify my gaps in knowledge. the more clarify in terms of specific services, libraries, modules, the better i can build a plan to get up to speed. not knowing what you don’t know is the most dangerous place to be, and often times in the beginning thats where you are. my approach is to try to make that initial stage as short as possible, and to build a concrete plan. From there try to determine the most efficient way to acquire functional knowledge to get up and running. When this is on the job (which is normally is) I can’t expect to take the most comprehensive way. I also don’t need to re- invent the wheel. Often times looking for good code examples or similar solutions is a great way. I like to tap into other teammates who have experience to at least get their input on the high level approach, as well as making sure Im taking advantage of the best resources/ references.

Most proud achievements:

- (OVERACHING CHALLENGE: starting from a blank slate, how do we go about translating coordinates that are layed out on a fixed 0,0, 1,1 coordiante space on the screen, and then meaningfully contextualize that in light of a live site that our client is testing.)

- the first place we started, was with looking at the way that existing web analytics tools approach this with things like heatmaps for clickspots and cursor movements. however, most of these tools that live in the browser just render a fairly static heatmap over a screenshot of the site.

- we decided, we cant be all things to all people. lets go with an approach that gives us the most flexibility moving forward, as well as an approach we can grow into (has the highest ceiling). i wanted to start with the harder problem. what is the mechanism through which a user defines an AOI, and how we connect an AOI that is defined by a client to what a user is actually looking on their phone. Needing to support different phone sizes and nuances in terms of site responsiveness. our approach that we felt would give us the most accuracy and relaibility was to base AOIs off DOM elements, which are going to generally align types of elements that our cleints want to track, wether it be a button, a menu, a group of icons, etc. we would allow you to group together multiple elemtns into a singel AOI, but the main thing was that the DOM elemtns provided this anchor that could tell us with pretty high confidence that when a reseracher designates a UI elemetn or group of UI elemtns, we know exactly where and how those are rendered across differnt tuypes of mobile devices. we woudl determine the unqiue CSS selector string, and use that to recontruct an AOI on the mobile device.

- our first prototype was actually a chrome exstension that adding a toolkit where you would go to the page you wanted to test, you would connect it to study, and you would use a the mouse cursor to define AOI.

- then we ended up packaging that toolkit into electorn, alonside with what at the time was a web app. and basically were able to get around CORS issues and browser restrictions that prevent us from providing a dynamic interface with which our users to interact with their live site using our toolkit.

- (Solving for quantitative analysis of gaze coordinates across a large dataset)

- we are receiving raw gaze coordinates that are on a fixed grid the size of a participatns phone.

- our goal is provide qualitative and quantiative insights that are contextualized within the content on the page. our goal was to make it as easy as possibel to get up and running. we would support running studies on hosted mockups like invision, but we also wanted to support live dynamic sites.

- the solution is a lot simpler when we are dealing with the qualitative data-  in our case thats a reseracher looking at a single page. in that case we can render the website at the same scale that it was shown on a users device and we can scale the coordiates appropriately.

- but one of our key value props was the ability to easily run eye tracking at scale and from the start we wanted a solution that would work to aggregate eye tracking data across a big group of participatns. in thsi case we would need to account for sites that would be rendered differently. elemtns aren't going to all scale proportionally across different screen sizes, so taht tactic could lead to innacuratces. the primary way that researches do quantitative anaylys across large datasets are through areas of interest. so we decided to take the tactic of achoring gaze coordinates to dom elements in a way that would handle responsive sites and allow us to wtih confidence know what element a user is looking at. (the method of allowing them to designate UI elements, group them together, etc, led us to from a chrome extension prototype to electron).

- (Solution for archiving dynamic web content)

- a screenshot serves as an archive, but is a lot more limiting when we use a screenshot as the background fro our data visualizing as opposed to visualzing it over a dynamic site. however with dynamic sites, we would potentially be dealing with.

- the other big challenge here was dealing with dynamic content and wanting to be able to replay a users gaze, scroll evetns, click evens, in full detail. basically capturing every bit of a users engagement with a dynamic page, including navigation, popups, dropdowns. our quick and fast solution was just to record a video of the screen, but we wanted to make it a richer more interactive experience as well as getting aroudn having to have a user wait for video uploads etc. so we were wroking on a solution where we would observe the DOM, and serialize it into JSON every time it was mutated. we would then stroe this, sotre the css and assets, and then were wroking to reconstruct the dom so we could accurately replay the session. (this also solved for live sites changing, a/b testing, etc). on face value this end result woudl be simialr to a vdieo, but this would give us the flexiblity to allow a reseracher to define new AOIs on the backend, to hover over elements to see more granual gaze data, etc.

FACIAL METERING

- Started with a problem. Having poor image quality in photos due to dynamic lighting changes. Especially in dark bars where people would take photos all hours of the day. if the Photo Booth was in a location with natural light, the setting would go from very bright to very dark at night. The current solution was relying on the autoexposure that was built into the React Native Camera module we were using, and this approach would just try to even out the exposure across the entire frame, without giving priority to any part of the image. if there was a wide difference between different parts of the frame, it wouldn’t know how to reconcile that and would just try to find a mid point. In dark settings, this often would mean that faces would be very blown out. We talked about a way to improve this and this was a feature I was excited to take ownership of. One of the initial ideas we tossed around was providing more manual controls so that the Photo Booth manager could adjust the exposure based on the environment, but we quickly realized that this was departing from one of our core value propositions, a Photo Booth that was as hands off as possible to own and operate. I ended up proposing the idea of identifying faces and using those faces to do a spot exposure to ensure that the our subject matter was given priority over other features in the frame.

- After considering a couple different camera modules, and considering writing our own camera module from scratch suing native iOS code, I settled on modifying the existing camera module that we were currently using to add facial recognition and exposure to the existing library. The downside here was that we would be creating a fork of a library was continued to be in active development and that would mean we would either need to ensure continued compatibility of our work as the library evolved, or we would need to look at getting our work merged into the library itself. After looking at the amount of work to write the entire camera module from scratch to have full ownership, we decided it would be better to add on, rather than try to re- invent the wheel here.

- The first step for me was to really dissect how the module worked. This meant diving into the inner workings of the way that React Native works, mainly the way that it provides a bridge between the javascript that you would typically write, and the native iOS elements. Secondly this meant familiarizing myself more with Objective C (which I had never working with before) and the native iOS camera API. Grasping these two things allowed me to understand how the existing camera module worked, and from there I could begin looking at implementing our new feature.

- I had kept my eye on the Vision framework that Apple released in June of 2017, which brought robust facial recognition and object tracking. From there I began adding into the existing camera module and extending it to harness the facial recognition to identify all faces in the frame, doing a check to compare the sizes off all the faces to find the largest face, and then conducting a spot export on the center of the largest face.

- Getting the coordinate spaces correct, and translating coordinate spaces between facial recognition, the spot to expose the face, and different device orientations was the most difficult part of this process. As well as working with the Vision framework, which as a new library, did not have much good documentary and required a lot of digging around to find good examples, as well as struggling through Apples documentation, which I’m not really fan of.

- From there we sent it out into the wild and began testing. We came across some bugs where the tracking would fail if it lost a face mid shot. I ended up building a debug app where we could download already recorded videos, feed problematic ones into the app, and then replay the facial tracking with with overlays to determine exactly what the tracking was doing and where it was going wrong, and how we could optimize it.

- The final refinement involved fine tuning the logic around when it would revert to automatic exposure mode, and when it would look to establish and track a primary face, and how it would respond if that track was lost.

- In the end it was incredibly gratifying to compare before and after pics of some of the problematic locations, where the new photos were a night and day difference.

BRANDING STUDIO

- Overlay generator. Starting with the goal of trying to eliminate the need for our clients to involve a graphic designer to create overlays for the Photo Booth or eliminate the need for them to have to use something like photoshop. Our goal was to create a studio within the dashboard that would provide them with a set of templates they could choose from, allow them to set the template colors to match their branding, and then upload logos, add text, and graphic elements, shapes, etc.

- I was tasked with architecting a solution for this. We knew that the end output needed to be a PNG to play nicely with our mobile apps. Apart from that the path to get there needed to be discovered.

- I viewed SVG’s as a nice vector format that could embed images, and could allow us to dynamically manipulate elements, potentially allowing for click and drag interface to refine images. I built a quick prototype with basic ability to add text and shapes and some really simple click to drag elements around a canvas. I also build an API endpoint that would take raw SVG and convert it into PNG. This worked, but it became clear that manipulating raw SVG was going to be very limiting when looking at building a more robust mouse interface on the canvas.

- Some more research led me to paper.js. Which provided a canvas that supported vector graphics, and had some great helper functions that provided options for scaling elements, and doing a lot of the math to determine distance between points, and hitTests for mouse clicks.

- I ended up rebuilding the prototype with paper.js and decided this was the route to go. I ended up building an interface that allowed dragging to reposition elements, dragging corners to resize or scale elements.

- Albert had created a basic interface. But as we moved along and better nailed down the use cases for a customer, we continually evolved the UI and layout and menu options in order to better align the studio with what we were hearing from customers. For this process I did a lot of extending the initial designs and filling in the blanks as we added things that weren’t in the designs.

- It was important for us to provide the infrastructure for users to save templates, and retrieve them for editing later on. This meant saving in a format that could be converted back into paper.js elements, and the output PNG would not work. I ended up saving a raw SVG output of the canvas with any logo embedded as a base64 image.

- The most challenging part of this was providing the ability to scale the canvas up and down, as well flipping the canvas on its side to allow the user to build portrait and landscape mode overlays. The other challenging part was implementing the math for the scaling and dragging to transform the elements. All this had to be done manually. so a click on a corner meant identifying the opposed corner, setting the as the anchor, and then modifying one corner but he x axis and other other corner by the y axis as you drag. and in the even that a user held down shift, all al the corners would need to be scaled to preserve the aspect ratio of the item. This was tricky but a lot of fun to sort out.

- In the end this was incredibly fun to build this end to end solution for creating branding overlays, and to see customers really positive responses and seeing them starting to test it and use it in the field.

**How I would go about making decision about a front end framework based on requirements and designer:**

- looking at the legacy codebase, seeing what work has been done and if this is brownfield or greenfield solution. balancing the benefits of working in the same language / framework, or rebuilding it with a new technology.

- looking at the makeup of the team, where the experience lies. aligning the stack with the core engineering teams strengths and experience.

- choosing a framework with longevity and good momentum. in the past year or so a lot of momentum has swung away from angular and towards react/vue. considering the support and dev team behind the framework. considering facebook and the react earlier this year with the BSD + patent license issue. considering vue being entirely community supported and open source with no strings attached. ideally looking for a framework that is not highly tied to the financial interests or IP of a single company.

- looking for a robust community for support, resources, plugins, components etc.

Vue vs React experiences and which would I choose

- I think vue is prettier. I prefer HTML over JSX and conditional or ternary rendering is a lot cleaner.

- Vue is just fun and easy to read, very simple to pick up. Can be integrated with existing frameworks or even static HTML sites incrementally.

- Both have great resuable components with is great, better than Angular.

- React has better runtime errors. Vue errors can be really vague.

- Not quite the same critical mass, React is more the default. Younger community. Has one mainly one guy behind it, rather than the resources of Facebook. Pros and Cons to that.

- React has wider adoption right now, with more third party libraries, bigger community. Vue Large chinese community, lots of the forum is in chinese and isn’t particularly useful for english speakers.

- Vue and React have similar state management. But Vue has a little more “magic” and more user friendly. Rather than calling “setState” to modify, you can directly modify, but it still is modifying in a predictable way. MobX is a great central state management library.

Pros/Cons and experiences working with code sharing and a modular approach that we implemented at Photomadic:

- What was great was reducing the complexity of our platform down to common utilities / modules. From and engineering standpoint, building with modularity in mind challenges you to organize your code well, challenges you to really think about efficiency, minimizing code duplication, and separation of concerns. It ensured that

**What did I not like about Photomadic?**

- missed out on the team feeling. worked largely remote with only two hours or so facetime each day. i did miss having additional facetime and getting to collaborate more closely with other engineers.

What did I not like about Locus?

**What questions do I have for them?**

- how is the engineering team structured? front- end? back- end? sizes? what does his interaction and relationship look like with the team?

- what do the team work rhythms look like? is everyone in the office every day? how are hours structured? do members take work home or is there an opportunity to work remotely some days (i live in south austin)?

- where is the work environment the strongest? what is he looking to improve? what is his favorite part about working there?

- what are opportunites for growth and promotion within the company?

- what are the goals for the engineering team over the next year?

- what are the biggest challenges and opportunities facing max digital and their product over the next couple years?

**Give an example of a time I had to collaborate with a person who was difficult to get along with? How did I handle interactions with that person?**

**Talk about the last time something significant didn’t go according to plan at work. What was my role? What was the outcome?**

**Recall a time when your manager was not available at work when a problem arose? How did you handle the situation? With whom did you consult?**

**Talk about a time when I had to juggle several projects at the same time. How did I organize my time? What was the result?**

**What is a time that I disagree with a decision at work? How did I handle it?**

**Where do I see myself in 5 years? What is my dream job?**

**How do I deal with stressful situation and pressure?**

**What is a development area, gap, deficit that I’ve had to overcome or improve in my career? How was that identified and what did I do to improve it?**

**Favorite supervisor and least favorite supervisor?**

**What are my strengths? Why should they hire me?**

- good collaborator, including going between technical and non- technical circles. i have experience working in client facing roles. i have experience working with technical and non- technical folks. ive done a lot of writing proposals, to pitching projects, to hiring creative teams. i think all these things have given me a strong ability to communicate and collaborate effectively with a broad group of people. honestly a lot of my closest friends come from places Ive worked at in the past and i think thats a testament to the fact that I really value strong realtionships in a workplace.

- im a hungry, quick learner, good at picking up new technologies and becoming productive in a short timeframe. im a very curious person and i truly love the process of learning and growing in my craft. people who know me can attest to the fact that i spend a lot of time outside of my job continuing to work with technology.

- thinking strategically about code / features / product in light of customer needs and product value. one of the things i loved about my time at photomadic and locus was how close we were to the end users of the product. i can be really effective on the product side and the technincal side. i think because of my diverse background, having spent a lot of time outside of a purely technical role I have a good sense for customer needs, aesthetics, user experience and ive learned and challenged myself to frame the technical work and feature development in light of the end product and customer experience.

**What are my weaknesses?**

- learning at locus to not get too caught in the weeds when tackling hard problems. early on there were times that i was so fixated on solving a problem that i didn't pay enough attention to high level goals, or neglected taking a step back to look at big picture issues. an example of this was when we were hacking through a chome extension, then electron, not spending enough time thinking about our trajectory and direciton as an engineering team. something i did to grow in this area was carving out some time at the end of every day to step back from code and product, and to have daily checkins as an engineering team. checking in with individual engineers to make sure they have clarify and have what they need to be productive.

- (CHASING WHAT IS IMMEDIATE IN THE MOMENT) I tend to naturally be somewhat of a procrastinator, and i can let immediate priorities override longer term goals. when there are a lot of fires to put out, sometimes the more important long term things can get overlooked. im generally going to do whatever it takes to finish big projects on time, i’ll pull an all nighter to get it done. and its doesnt need to be that way, i had time earlier on to do things at a more reasonable pace, but i didn't prioritize things soon enough.

EXAMPLE: At Photomadic sometimes I could get caught chasing “urgent” customer issues, rather than continueing to make good progress on the platform issues over the long term. Worked to address this by blocking out time in the day for certain issues. Would generally not dedicate more than a certain percentage of my time to “firefighting”, with some exceptions, but putting boundaries around that to make sure we were still asking progress on the most important high level goals.

- Because I do a good job living up high level, this sometimes comes a the cost of not being the most detail oriented, particularly around considering edge cases. Learning to slow down, to better proof read my code, to get a second pair of eyes on my code. To write better tests for my code to ensure I am considering all the possible inputs.

- saying no. im a people pleaser. hardest things was for me saying no to clients in regads to the scope of projects. i want to make them happy, and i was also so invested in the project that i would sacrifice more, wether it be to make it as good as possible, this could come at a cost. cerego. Learning to be more realistic about timelines, work involved, knowing when to speak up or push back respectfully if I sense things aren’y realistic.

**Moment of conflict or challenge with a teammate/supervisor?**

- (HIRING ALLYSON): this was a point of conflict between myself and our CTO. She was hoenstly not qualified, and to bring on an engineer who would have to learning to code on the job was something I was very much against (let alone a sister) for obvious reasons. I had a number of very open conversatios with the CTO (both of the founders were great about inviting honest conversations and we had great rapport), where I was able to tactfully but also honeslty voice my concerns. It became clear that she was going to be part of this team, so at that point I decided to accept that, and then focus on how to make the most out of the situation, how to set her up with the best chance to learn. No point in lettign it be a friction point or becoming bitter. Choose your battles, and then move on when its over. Dont' let it drag on. I think we were able to make the most out of having a VERY junior developer involved. She was able to contribute and make improvements. Still not the decision I would have ever made, but I think we did make the most out of it.

- (BEING TO MUCH OF A "REALIST"): One of our product guys and I were at a startup event. On the way home, we were talking about or professional goals and personal growth. He asked if he could share some feedback and then brought up a discussion we had regarding when to launch the product, when it would be ready. He said he felt like I was being too negative about the state of the product and its readiness. He chalenged me to be a little more of an idealist and that thats an attitude that is necessary in startups. I took what he said to heart, and I could see how what he said was true. From there forward it became a bit of an inside joke, who was going to play the idealist and who was going to be the pragmatist. But I do lean heavily towards being bery pragmatic, and trying to plan for the worst case, and now I am tyring to balance that out with some healthy idealism.

- (FUNDRAISING): I disagreed with our fundraising tactics and felt for a while that we didn't have enough runway for the strategy we were utilizing. I spoke openly with the both fo the founders about this. Made my case, felt like I was heard, but also recognize that my role is support the founders in their vision and decisions, even if I don't agree with it. That was the case, once we made the decision to release early, I swtiched gears and did everything I could to set us up for success with getting the product ready.

- working with Dan at e3. challenged by feeling like we would have a conversation, tackle a fear of his, solve the problem, begin moving forward. and three days later he would be stuck on the same thing that i thought we solved. this happened as we were building our itinerary and picking locations. talking through our reason for each location, how it provided unique insight or a unique angle. coming to consensus but then having it called into question a couple days later. CORE TO DEALING WITH CONFLICT - > Empathy. Understand that there is a reason for the behavior that is generally rooted in painful experiences, in this case. He had been burned in the past by people who had leash to play with, and didn’t deliver a meaningful product or were possibly wasteful with resources. realizing this gave me a lot of patience to listen to his concerns, to echo those back to him to help him feel heard, and then to address those specific concerns. empanthizing with that helped me to build common ground with him. where it was countless meetings, proposals, budgets, review. it took time, but ultimately it paid off.

- working with Ken on complex travel sets. He was the producer and I was the director, we had a team of about 5 crew and spent a combine almost 2 months on the road in about 8 cities, a week in each city. Long days, often 12- 16 hour days. He was a great communicator, great and pitching projects and getting funding, however logistics were not his strong point. This became really painful when we were in such a logistically complex area. Crew, including myself started getting very frustrated with the lack of planing that put us in situations like having a to a haul lots of film gear 20 blocks through snow in downtown new york city as he kept on messing up directions and taking us to the wrong place. it ended in us butting heads and having a really heated discussion about needing to figure this out and avoid these kind of mistakes and inefficiencies, we just didn’t have the margin with how demanding this shoot was. at one point he nearly broke down and said he couldn’t do this, it was too much, and he started saying he was going to need to leave the production. LESSON - > Empathy. Realizing that he really was trying to manage things. He was out of his wheelhouse and he was really trying to do a good job. We had this honest conversation where I shared my frustations and the frustrations of the crew, and he shared how overwhelmed and stressed he was. It helped me see where he was coming from. We ended up talking about how we could do to delegate some of the logistical responsibilities away from him so he could be freed up to focus on his core copentenczies. We agreed to make our production assistant in charge of navigating us and making sure everyone knew where we needed to be next and how to get there. I took over more of the day to day planning and creating a daily schedule each night so we had things locked down prior to the start of the next day. LESSON -  > Clear communication. Get ahead of things, don’t let them blow up. We should have acknowledged this earlier rather than waiting for it to get as bad. Give them credit where its due. Approach things as a team, remember we are all on the same team and want the best outcome from this trip.

**Mistake or Failure?**

- (ADOPTING THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF PROCESS)we spent a while trying to figure out the right amount of process that would serve us well. early on, i think we didn't have enough process. it was very free- flow in terms of what we were working on. we would have converstaions about what to work on and then we would execute without having much written down. i ended up overreacting by adding too much process after that. we went with full sprints, sizing stories, tracking velocity. which was a little too overkill for where we were at as a team. eventually we ended up finding a good rhythum for where we were at. we ended up implementing a stripped down agile methodoliogy. week sprints with daily checkings. we cut out a lot of more detailed tracking that felt to process oriented, and used daily engineering chekings as a way to stay on the same page. LESSON LEARNED. Constatly evaualte. Listen to what everyone has to say. Adjust and implement changes when needed.

- Can't think of a bit failure (obviously lots of things I wasn't satisfied with in myself, and looking to improve, but largely because we were developing internally there were not consequences as much).

- plenty of times my code didn't run, or i spent too long chasing soemthing that turned out to be a deadend.

- My first or second week on the job, I deleted a bunch of photos from a live client gallery that were not retrievable. LESSON - > Admit your mistake ASAP, own up to the error + call in reinforcements if necessary, offer to do what you need to try to migitage the fallout, learn about what cause your mistake, and do your best not top repeat.

- crashing the family heirloom VW van on production. LESSON - > Own the mistake. Take responsibility, don’t pass the blame. And then think creatively about how to mitigate the situation. Help offset the pain as much as possible. (shoot the other side of the van. pull footage and help with the insurance claim).

- Situation that is in recent memory at my last job. Queueing issue in React Native. Sometimes when objects were put into the Queue, they would come out missing some properties or methods. But 90 percent of the time in the use cases it worked fine. Beat my head against the wall trying to solve this issue. Dug into the React Native source code to try to find what has happening. Eventually I had to admit defeat and call in re- inforcements. I pulled Albert in and we worked together to nail down the issue. In certain circumstances the items in the queue would be serialized as they were stored, and then de- serialized as they were fetched. In this process. the object proprtype would get modified and we would lose methods and some properties. LESSON - > Be humble. Ask for help. Learn and move on.

- Brain tumor during first attempt at Galvanize. Had to drop out. LESSON - > Use failures, challenges to make yourself more hungry and to push yourself harder to succeed.
