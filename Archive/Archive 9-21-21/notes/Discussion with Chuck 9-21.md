Things to discuss with Chuck / Faith state of the union 9-21

- discussing the tensions with Lara, his perspective on discernment and being wise in this area.
	- on balancing the tough aspect that she will probably not be "a christian" in the explicit sense when id need to figure this out
	- on handling my fear of commitment, fear of stepping outside the bounds of traditional christian wisdom on relationships, alongside the fact that I am incredibly confident and happy and secure in our relationship and our future

- personal wrestling
	- i can sense in myself wanting to return to a new kind of legalism as a point of spiritual safety. being able to define a new set of boundaries so that I can say I am good, i have a barometer with which i can measure how things are going with God, rather than looking at my heart and looking at myself honestly.
	- tension with how to read the bible. has he gone through a transformation here? reading it through fresh eyes. can't help but feel like so much of it seems locked up in this old cultural context. and it seems not the normal way you would approach any literature- to transplant explicit directions to a first century church as a 1:1 model into the 21st century. 
	- on not feeling totally at home in either conservative or progressive theologies- on admiring the commitment of conservatives (of all the things you can fault them for, they are serious about living it out) with the softness, gentleness, and culture impact of progressives (while also feeling uncomfortable with how it sometimes feels like crafting a faith that just fits what i want it to be. not doing a lot of wrestling with harder scripture- or just leaving them behind).
	- wrestling with the sexual ethic from evangelicalism. 
		- to me this is this personal case study: this messy area of trying to understand and apply 1st century sexual ethics, legalism, personal biases / fears / desires.
		- there is also this baggage, this sense that if i am not really denying my flesh, my bodily desires aren't feeling deprived (this type of aetheticism) then I am clearly just week or just building an easy convenient practice of faith.
		- i certainly slipped up a bit going into my first marriage, but i really aspired to the traditional ethic. i lived in this cycle of messing up, confessing, shame and guilt. and never really made much progress. the solution was getting married and having a really frustrated, somewhat stifled sex life. 

- his view
	- what is your biggest struggle with faith now? what is your unresolved tension?
	- how is he really doing?
	- curious what the pillars of his daily / weekly faith practice look like? this has been one thing on my mind, figuring out a healthier way to re-engage with the "classic discplines".
