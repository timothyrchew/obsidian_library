- review this post with very good detail: https://www.teamblind.com/post/Giving-back---how-I-cleared-L6-System-Design---Part-1-4yufM3RY
- good overview of persons approach to studying for OOP interviews: https://www.davidseek.com/ood/


- get my mindset right. jot down some mantras and affirmations. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFOw_m5zNCs&list=PLy0VFhNW0Gi3m2gmIXmJVB1RGCh8yHGep&index=1&ab_channel=PragmaticEngineer. 
	- approach all interviews as a chance to learn and grow. don't worry about the outcome. flip my current attitude on its head. don't worry about failure. the more i do, the more practie i get, the more comfortable i can get, and more i can fill in gaps in my knowledge.
