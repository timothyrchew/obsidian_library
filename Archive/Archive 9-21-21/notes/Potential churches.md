# Churches
- Vox
- Christ church
- St Davis
- Austin New Church
- Servant Church (UMC)
- eastside community church
- sunrise church (more conservative, but doing radical work with homeless)
- covenant presbyterian (reformed, but accounts on reddit of them being very accepting to someone agnostic. also cancelled 10 million in medical debt for those in need)
- st james episcopal (very diverse, very affirming, very socially engaged, but seems older folks and maybe less relatable)
- church and highland park (all female leadership, liturgical, met a guy from this church that was visiting ANC)
