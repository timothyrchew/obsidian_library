# Exit interview

what drew me to the company
- i was really attracted to the mission. the sexiness of the 'tackling disinfo' was incredibly interesting to me and subject i cared a lot about so frankly it was a dream space to work in.
- wanted to be in startups, but wanted a slightly more mature org than i had been part of in the past. when i joined it really fit in the sweet spot of not too big, but more engineers to learn from.

sum up experiences here
- a lot of product work. positive and negative sides to that
- a lot of reps building interfaces to about 80% done and pushing it out. and rinse and repeat.
- ive felt really supported by coworkers and leadership. i know there are others that felt burned. but as for me, im walking away with a lot of appreciation for how ive been treated and looked after here.

impressions of yonder changing
- i think my impressions of yonder have evolved as the organization itself evolved. 
- eng org started out closer to what i had imagined, and then evolved to become a lot more loosely coupled, a lot more scrappy.

my position change
- started as an individual contributor -> a lot more product work as a squad lead, and then throughout the launching of the curation page. to where i felt like i was doing too much product work, too many cooks in the kitchen, and then asked to be more an IC again to focus on technical growth. and that has been really the last 6 - 9 months.

things i learned at yonder
- i learned a lot on the product side
- there has been a lot of organizational change and company change over the course of the last 2 years. ive learned a lot about team dynamics, product vision, company strategy taht have been valuable. 
- i got to take the reins of a couple bigger features and defitinely grew a lot of confidence in my technical abilities too

best thing
- i do feel like the team here genuinely tries to figure out where you want to go, and then does their best to support you in that. a lot of companies say that, but few actually embrace that. i do really feel like the engineering team + leadership as a whole has done a great job with this and definitely soemthing i appreciate.
- we are trusted to be adults. we are given a lot of leash. ive definitely appreciated that a lot during my time here.

accomplishments
- developing and spearheading the daily curation workflow. i had the chance to really stretch into the product side and mocks in ways that i had never done. and in the end it led to a product that i think really made a big difference in the QoL for our analyst. seeing it get used, seeing it fullfill its role was very satisfying.

how did i decide to leave
- slow burn of losing some of the key collaborative relationships i had in the past. feeling very silod in my work.
- feeling like my motivations, my work ethos was increasingly out of sync with the remaining team
- struggling with the product vision. tired of rebuilding the same features again and again with slightly different window dressing. tired of seeing all the inefficiencies and repeated mistakes. lack of strong product / ui direction made things increasingly exausting as a frontend dev. it became really exhausting to stay emotional engaged witht he product. once that was gone, the work became really difficult.
- although the acquisition goal came up during the interview process and was not the initial impetus- it did make me feel moreso like i made the right decision. ive been around startups enough to know that nothing is guaranteed, and acquisition is not guaranteed, there have been fundraising challenges, the valuation is likely going to make our options worthless, and id rather be more proactive about my future. 

dealbreakers
- no deal breakers. i didn't feel like i needed to leave. i think it was just a slow realization that i could continue waiting things out, but that things were not likely to change. and so i would probably be best off exploring some new opportunities. but it was sad. my first choice would have been to stay. i feel like i wasn't bringing my best self to work because of that tension. not fair to myself or the team.

what yonder could have done different to make me stay
- i think yonder can be a really good fit, or not a great fit depending on what you are looking for. (profound statement i know)
- realisticaly it think the struggles i had are related to more fundamntal eng / product culture, and realistically weren't going to change. so there are no hard feelings or this sense that ive benn wronged. i certaintly held out hope for quite a while that there would be improvements. spoke to chelsea in depth about some of this. it was just a process of acknowledging it for what it is, recognizing that it probably wouldn't change (and that is more so true in light of the acquisition strategy).

any advice for them
- keep being really transparent in the acquisition. don't oversell the upside and end up with dissapointed people.
- from a culture standpoint, i don't think i have any advice. i recognize that the goals have shifted significantly, and so this is really not about building a cutlure for the longterm, its about getting across the finish line.

relationship with managers
- ive got a ton of respect for chelsea. she is a fantastic executive. i did feel bad for her at times, because i have to imagine this is not what she signed up for. and i think that what our engineering team needs is slightly mismatched with her biggest strengths- which are about casting a vision, operations and growing eng teams. so it feels like she is very overqualified for the team in many ways, which has to be tough for her. 
	- i think the fact that she is not actively technical has at times led to a disconnect between her stated goals and ethos, and the way the team operates on a ground level. frankly, ive seen people take advantage of that in the way they deliver. she is really the only person who would be an enforcer of any kind when it comes to standard of work and standard of engagement and effort. dennis is not that person. so i think the team has suffered some as a result of her not being as engaged on that level.

relationship with company management
- i don't have a ton to add here. overall its been positive. 

relationship with team
- on an individual level ive had good relationships with everyone. but ill acknowledge this has been a point of tension for me.
- when i joined ill admit that i was a bit surprised by how laid back it was- to the point where people would just regularly check peace out at 3pm.
- and this is just not how im wired. im pretty driven to grow, to learn, to contribute. and a big part of my job satisfaction is in the collaborting with others who are motivated in the same way. i recognize everyone is wired differently and im not a hardass about that. and i ahve been able to build thos types of relationships with individuals- cavalli was the best example of this. we really connected and i loved working with him for a lot of those reasons.
- when we went remote- that dynamic shifted even more. i won't lie, at times it was really frustrating. i know chelsea was awareof some of these dynamics- but im not sure she was aware of just to the extend that some folks were taking advantage of the distance. and it just reallty started affecting my ability to do my work well- things getting dropped. people saying stuff was finished and got shipped, when i could see they straight up did not do the work and i felt like they were being dishonest in what was said during standup. and this meant i was having to go back to fix stuff. i have having to pick up additional work to cover for some of lapses. 
- that really drained on me. when cavalli left, when cori left those were both two key guys that i felt i was on the same page with. and i felt like there was just a fundamental disconnect in what people.
