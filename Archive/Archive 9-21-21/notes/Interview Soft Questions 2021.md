# Key Things I should be able to answer

- What interests me about te current opportunity / industry
- 3 technical projects that I can walk through in detail
- 1 project that didn't go well and how I handled it
- Stories about handling tough situations with other people (difficult coworkers, PM, boss, interpersonal issues, dissagrements, tight deadlines)
- Example of making a decision given 2 options, how evaluated them, tradeoffs, and then made a decision



# Specific to this opportunity
- what attracts me to bond / fintech
	- i really enjoy the energy, excitement of startups. i really enjoy the sense of ownership and closeness to the product. there is often a much higher degree of cross functional collaboration that happens at startups compared to more silod work that can happen at larger orgs. so all these things are aspects that id love to carry over to my next opportunity.
	- the second piece, which is would guess is the case at bond, is about looking to join a slightly more mature engineering team. and i don't mean matturity in the sense of how long the team has existed. but really looking the next level of precision, of code qualtiy, and thoroughness in the art of building software that does not often go hand in hand with early stage startups. the cool thing about fintech is that by the nature of the industry, it requires elevating the bar for quality and precision. im continuing to optimize for growth in my career and this is the next key piece that im looking for.
	- lastly, its obviously really important that i really beleive in the opportunity that the company is pursuing and that im really bought into the vision and beleive in the potential. im a product guy and so its gotta be something that i can really see myself really digging and developing a sense of pride about.


# Career overview

- have taken a non- traditional path into software engineering. i spent a larger part of the last decade working in the film industry, as a cintematographer before moving into more producing and direction.
	- i went to film school and UT and spent a number of years traveling around the world as Cinematographer
	- and then founded and grew a full service film production company, where I was focused a lot more assembling and leading creative teams to develop and execute on film concepts for our clients.
	- those efforts culminated in our company getting acquired by a larger agency, so i took that chance to pivot into a another passion of mine. took that chance to negotiate my way out.
	- i love the creative process of building things, i love the intersection between innovative solutions and graceful, product design, beautiful interfaces. i had dabbled in coding for a while on the side and had always enjoyed it but just didn't have the space or time to fully dive in.
	- so i took that opportunity to pivot and to stretch myself in some new areas. I kickstarted this  by going to Galvanize in 2016, 6 months intensive program.

- since then have worked my way through three startups, each of which has been a pretty different stage of growth.
	- bootstrapped organic growth startup focused on cloud-driven, ipad based photobooths
	- first engineering hire at a super early stage tech stars startup working on mobile based eye tracking software. were i built out and led the engineering team.
	- to now closing in on 2 years a yonder.


# Yonder summary

- Company overview
	- As a company, Yonder was initially focused on detecting and tracking disinformation online. Helping both public sector clients and corperate clients navigate the intersetion between malicious or coordinated online activity and the corperate or public interests, especially across fringe, under the radar space that are often the precursor to narratives that gain a much more mainstream audience down the road. 
		- More recently expanding this into helping clients comprehensively surface online discussions about things they care about. and then helping them understand the detail anatomy of that discussion, including what interests are represented here, who are the distinct communities or intersest groups involved, how was the narrative evolved or time, and then where might it head as well as how they might respond.
	- Two distinct stages that the company has been at, that have each had some really distinctly interesting problesm to tackle
		- The company has build an impressive client list and fairly mature revenue with a team of analyst, customer success memeber using a suite of our proprietary internal tools. And I joined right in the build up to launching a client facing platform, that would put our tools into our clients hands in a way that would allow us to migrate away fromt he white- glove approach and mroe towards a scalable platform.
		- So Ive been very much in the trenches of figuring out how translate our unqiue insights and approach that we've devepoed with incredible data science team, and how we put that in a product.
		- The second stage- is one where we have really hit our stride with our deliverables. But we need to make things more scalable. We need to automate more processes. We need our tools to more efficiently augment the parts of the process that do rely on a layer of human insight from our analyst. And we need to open up our tools and platforms to some very large external partners that will be incorperating our offering, insights, tools into their offerings.

- In my first 2 roles, I was in a fairly true full stack roll working pretty equallty between the frontend and backend of the stack.
- At yonder I have been on the product egnineering team much more towards the frontend of the stack working with React, and also doing a bit of work in our backend python codebase, which is has been both with flask and django. 
	- I pride myself in being pretty resourceful and scrappy when it comes to working across the full stack, but I will also admit that in the last 2 years I've definitely spend a lot more time going deeper into the frontend, thats where I would consider my expertise and strength from a technical standpoint.
- I've been pretty heavily involved on the product side at yonder. The nature of where the company is has meant there has been a lot of focus on taking what was initially quite a white glove, service driven business model within the disinfo / brand integrity space serving a mix of public sector / commercial clients, and looking to grow into more of self-service, scalable sass model. 
	- within this work, transition at yonder, i have done quite a bit product work that has included working closely with our leadership team, cross-functional collaboration across our company, meeting wth clients, and then owning feature work that has included my builidng mocks, doing user testing, and then spearheading and interating on a couple bigger features as we've worked to solidify the self service model.
- I have had the chance to own and spearhead a couple features, including a pretty high profile tool that is at the core of our value proposition when it comes to our third party partnerships.


# Key accomplishments

## Yonder

- Spearheading the Daily Digest curation workflow- publishing our insights in a published and emailable form.
	- problem: 
		- (analyst efficiency) we have sophisticated data insights tools that scape social posts, run analysis on them, and them generate insights. our analyst collect insights from our internal tools and compile them into google slide reports that get manually sent to clients. but those two processes where very decoupled and very timeconsuming for our analyst to collect the insights from our tool and compile them into a good looking report. the lift was to prototype and build a tool that enabled a seemless workflow in which our data pipelines would generate an initial report within a frontend UI, where an analyst could quickly jump in, have it presented in a concise way, and then they could tweak, edit, polish content, before then hitting a publish button that would then compile the report into email and an in app version that would get sent to clients.
		- (visual overhaul). updating a pretty rough template. steps towards dashboard, while still satisfying the need for self-containted, emailable reports.
			- this tool would be used by external analysts. we have partnered with a couple fortune 100 consulting firms that would be implementing this into their workflow. needing to raise the bar- making it more userfriendly and polished.
	- my role: 
		- product lead / frontend lead
		- i took lead on designing the curation workflow and interface and our approach for best enabling our analysts to bridge the gap between our data pipeline outputs and the polished, curated reports that ended up in our clients hands
	- process:
		- understand the painpoint and usecase as much as possible. identify both the pain but also opportunities to add new value
			- meeting with analysts. fully understanding their painpoints and friction they have felt in the report generation process. picking their minds for how we can imporve the fromat and reduce their workload.
			- meeting with customer success and sales
				- gathering as much into about whats going well and where we can imporve. looking ahead and what opps sales are seeing in their calls.
			- meeting with clients. understanding how they are consuming the dialy digest. what else they would like to see. how we can better surface the most important content.
		- take the time to get our prototype right before going further
			- building a lose clickable prototype and then conduction user testing to refine the designs. 
			- pulling in a very diverse set of teammates to do user testing with. A mix of marketting, sales, analysts., and or CIO. 
			- challenge of navigating a bunch of different opinions and feedback that would at times directly contradict one another
				- pulling in wide set of opinions was by design, and part of the intention was to really shatter our preconceived notions about how this should work. 
		- partnered with our direction of eng (who owned the backend dev for this feature) while I owned the frontend to define the roadmap and break down the work.
		- then going heads down and building out the frontend
	- challenges:
		- interpersonal
			- the circumstances in which i took over this project. we had another frontend focused engineer who was more senior than i was and had been given the project lead responsibilities for one of the iniatives that was the lead up to this curation piece. this was around dashboard to manage and run reports. the engine behind the report generation and monitoring. he was someone that is really talented engineer, more capabale and experienced than i was and he was the natural choice to spearhead this. 
				- without getting into it, there were some personal issues that were beginning to affect his level of engagement and follow through.
				- one of our hard deadlines was a key demo our CEO was going to do a fortune 100 consulting company that was considering making us part of their core offering. and he had stated that having this part of the app being demoable was would be a huge benift towards demonstrating our tech and the direction of the product. 
				- the project lead had planned vacation the week before the demo, had made commitments about getting the feature done for the demo, fell behind, and the left. 
				- i ended up stepping in, and really busting my butt. for me there is something really exhilerating about having a deadline, and having something i can own and getting across the line to meet a real need. i love that pressure. so i ended up pulling a couple very late nights and a all nighter the night leading up to the demo. i got it shipped.
				- the result was our CTO was not happy with the other eng and was very happy with me. and it was clear that the other eng was not very thrilled and resented a bit that i was leading the next one.
				- i will admit that initially i felt a bit guilty and awkward with that dynamic. i respect this engineer and liked working with him, but he had realy dropped the ball in a key moment. 
					- my approach was really to make it a point to very proactively bring him into the creative side and the product deliverations, which i knew where parts he really enjoyed probably the most. 
					- we also had a very open discussion. i acknowledged the elephant in the room. and just reinforced my appreciation for his product and design chops, and made it clear i wanted to make him as much of a partner in this as he wanted to be. that didn't dissolve the tension of course. but i think that open, frank conversation did serve as a reset and we were able to have a healthy working realtionship on the project.
		- product
			- difficult finding sources for inspiration and examples of existing apps that tackled this same problem. i really like to look at how others have solved this problem and i like to really dive into different approaches. closest i found was mailbrew (a service that would allow you to build a daily feed from different sources of our choice). the mechanisms for curation your feed were helpful.
			- stradling the line between a streamlined, structured curation workflow that aimed for efficiency, while still allowing analysts enough control over the output. deciding where to be opinionated and where to be flexible. 
			- keeping the long term vision in line: 
				- we wanted to move from reports to a dashboard experience. a lot of our big clients need reports. and yet we really see the future being around a self service model. so we had to keep a foot in each camp this time around. everything we did around publishing needed to be supported in email. which is a nightmare. so i worked through quite a few iterations here, did a bunch of email cleint testing, learned more about this than i ever would want to know frankly. 
				- keeping this flexible in terms of content type. supporting more content types. establishing a flexbile framework that we could easily expand and add onto moving forward.
			- tricky UX tradeoffs- what is the editing mechanism like? how do we gracefully enable jumping between high level view while allowing them to drill down into details and make edits? how do we enable a preview mode?

---



- Revamping the conversation builder
	- biggest piece was solving import / export piece + boolean support
	- also refined copy / paste between fields, copy and paste between spreadsheets. adding new query types and building out the backend updates to support this. 


- Solving for imports and exports for our proprietary query structure. Build a tool that allows user to write standard boolean query that would be converted into our queries and vice versa.
	- problem:
		- imporve the conversation building approach. allow non-technical analysts to easily save, modify, import conversations queries into our propreitary format
		- longer term: open the door for third party integrations moving foward.
	- my role:
		- designed solution and did implementation on this project entirely solo. 
	- tech challenges:
		- legacy query approach that was not built with this type of interface in mind (plain text quries or boolean queries).
		- it needs to be really solid. if this is not realiable, it would be really easy for errors to slip through the cracks unoticed, while causing the underlying queries to not work as intended.
	- tech approach https://app.nuclino.com/Yonder/Engineering/Conversation-Boolean-Query-Format-b99c7068-f0a0-442b-a8b9-bc95c2a00203:
		- settled on boolean query as the ideal approach, but had ackknowledged that we would have to do our own flavor of boolean due to some unique requirements of our query approach. for we needed to be able to build a single query that could contain serveral clauses, each of which would need to be scoped to a certain entity type. 
		- built off a lucene query parser that would convert boolean query into a AST. and then i wrote a layer ontop of this that would convert the AST into our query structure. that was definitely the tyrickiest part. going from our backend query into lucene boolean query was a fully custom approach, and much easier given we were starting with data that was already structured as a query. it was much easier to build a string from that. 
		- build pretty robust unit testing for this
		- created documentaiton and conduction a training session for our analysts
		- refined this over time- issues like different types of quotes. some nuances with chinese characters. (go back and look at slack posts with robert and nick to pull up specific examples we worked through).
		- this evoled into something that our third party clients are using to pull in queries from other data tools. so it was cool to see how at the time, the third party integrrations was still somewaht hypothetical. but i put in some extra legwork to go with an approach that would enable this. and sure enough, this use case became a thing and we were already positioned to support it immediately. and it helped seel the deal with a couple client deals.

- leadig the investigation into new viz library. building out our new base set of visualizations and implementing storybook for displaying them and collabing with our UX director.
	- moved from chartjs to visx. going low level, highly customizable. knowing that no matter the design or look and feel, we can do it and customize it almost infinitely. still tapping into the power of d3 while.

- working with frontend team to re-architext the React app.
	- greenfield project. deciding what to keep from old conventions, what to leave behind or what to change.
		- using hooks (why?)
			- reusability
			- lighter functional components
		- dropping redux and a lot of the bloat that came with that in favor or a lighter, context + mobx approach (why?)
		- using storybook for reusable components
		- adding e2e testing, unit, and snapshot testing (be able to give examples of each)
		- solving for difficulty getting "real" data in the frontend when doing local dev (using django factories and building stub.json payload that is loaded into the local db when its built)

- Leading a squad that prototypes and built the explore page. Building the explore page- solving for the fact that our app is great at looking with a telescope at what is happening, but struggled with providing a high level overview of the terms.

- working with a backend team to rethink our API structure, how to improve performance. utilizing some of the opportunities like caching pre- calculated json blobs. we were calulating a lot of metrics and datasets on the fly, despite that fact that our ingest pipeline and ML job generally run hourly. Harnessing this and generating json blobs hourly. Matching routes to widgets in a 1:1 way that allowed for caching, and async prototping.

- working with a small group in the company to design a plan and implementation for rolling out squads
	- some distinctives
		- how would squads be organized
		- a process for submitting new squad ideas
		- the squad poster wall
	- moving forward
		- i was the squad lead
		- things to discuss more
			- challenges in coordinating with other squads. dealing with a ton of communications overhead. constantly zooming in and out- as the only person who could do frontend dev for a feature that was pretty frontend heavy, while also leading the group
			- some tension with taylor who was resentful. i was the least tenured in the group- and a couple were more senior than i was. in that group was our senior product manager. i heard that directly from someone else, but i could sense some of that. 
				- key was to really denomstrate that i didn't see anything about the role meaning there was an inherant heiarachy or priveledge. the role was really about facilitating internally, communicating outward to the rest of the company. so i really wanted to dispell this sense that there was any special about the role. i was still in the trenches, equally focused on contributing code. 
				- when taylor left, he told me i was his favorite engineer to work with at the company. maybe he told that to everyone, but by the end it had gone from a bit tense to a really great working relationship and rapport. 

## Locus

- in charge of designing, building, and launching our early access MVP. meeting wthi SMEs, travelaing on side to companies like Facebook and Homeway, Indeed to learn about their UI / UX process.
- Solving for how we take eye trackuig coordinates on a fixed grid and normalize them at scale for dynamic web content across all kinds fo screen sizes and device types. building our system for AOIs- the interface for designating them and then collecting user info around them.

Most proud achievements:

- (OVERACHING CHALLENGE: starting from a blank slate, how do we go about translating coordinates that are layed out on a fixed 0,0, 1,1 coordiante space on the screen, and then meaningfully contextualize that in light of a live site that our client is testing.)

- the first place we started, was with looking at the way that existing web analytics tools approach this with things like heatmaps for clickspots and cursor movements. however, most of these tools that live in the browser just render a fairly static heatmap over a screenshot of the site.

- we decided, we cant be all things to all people. lets go with an approach that gives us the most flexibility moving forward, as well as an approach we can grow into (has the highest ceiling). i wanted to start with the harder problem. what is the mechanism through which a user defines an AOI, and how we connect an AOI that is defined by a client to what a user is actually looking on their phone. Needing to support different phone sizes and nuances in terms of site responsiveness. our approach that we felt would give us the most accuracy and relaibility was to base AOIs off DOM elements, which are going to generally align types of elements that our cleints want to track, wether it be a button, a menu, a group of icons, etc. we would allow you to group together multiple elemtns into a singel AOI, but the main thing was that the DOM elemtns provided this anchor that could tell us with pretty high confidence that when a reseracher designates a UI elemetn or group of UI elemtns, we know exactly where and how those are rendered across differnt tuypes of mobile devices. we woudl determine the unqiue CSS selector string, and use that to recontruct an AOI on the mobile device.

- our first prototype was actually a chrome exstension that adding a toolkit where you would go to the page you wanted to test, you would connect it to study, and you would use a the mouse cursor to define AOI.

- then we ended up packaging that toolkit into electorn, alonside with what at the time was a web app. and basically were able to get around CORS issues and browser restrictions that prevent us from providing a dynamic interface with which our users to interact with their live site using our toolkit.

- (Solving for quantitative analysis of gaze coordinates across a large dataset)

- we are receiving raw gaze coordinates that are on a fixed grid the size of a participatns phone.

- our goal is provide qualitative and quantiative insights that are contextualized within the content on the page. our goal was to make it as easy as possibel to get up and running. we would support running studies on hosted mockups like invision, but we also wanted to support live dynamic sites.

- the solution is a lot simpler when we are dealing with the qualitative data-  in our case thats a reseracher looking at a single page. in that case we can render the website at the same scale that it was shown on a users device and we can scale the coordiates appropriately.

- but one of our key value props was the ability to easily run eye tracking at scale and from the start we wanted a solution that would work to aggregate eye tracking data across a big group of participatns. in thsi case we would need to account for sites that would be rendered differently. elemtns aren't going to all scale proportionally across different screen sizes, so taht tactic could lead to innacuratces. the primary way that researches do quantitative anaylys across large datasets are through areas of interest. so we decided to take the tactic of achoring gaze coordinates to dom elements in a way that would handle responsive sites and allow us to wtih confidence know what element a user is looking at. (the method of allowing them to designate UI elements, group them together, etc, led us to from a chrome extension prototype to electron).

- (Solution for archiving dynamic web content)

- a screenshot serves as an archive, but is a lot more limiting when we use a screenshot as the background fro our data visualizing as opposed to visualzing it over a dynamic site. however with dynamic sites, we would potentially be dealing with.

- the other big challenge here was dealing with dynamic content and wanting to be able to replay a users gaze, scroll evetns, click evens, in full detail. basically capturing every bit of a users engagement with a dynamic page, including navigation, popups, dropdowns. our quick and fast solution was just to record a video of the screen, but we wanted to make it a richer more interactive experience as well as getting aroudn having to have a user wait for video uploads etc. so we were wroking on a solution where we would observe the DOM, and serialize it into JSON every time it was mutated. we would then stroe this, sotre the css and assets, and then were wroking to reconstruct the dom so we could accurately replay the session. (this also solved for live sites changing, a/b testing, etc). on face value this end result woudl be simialr to a vdieo, but this would give us the flexiblity to allow a reseracher to define new AOIs on the backend, to hover over elements to see more granual gaze data, etc.


## Photomadic

- Solving for the facial metering problem. Dropping from React Native into the native Objective C code to build a customer metering module that dramatically improved the quality of our photos
- [[Interview Soft Questions 2020]]
- Branding studio. building an interface that was a WYSIYG interface for desining graphic layouts and then pushing them to photoboths remotely in real time.

FACIAL METERING

- Started with a problem. Having poor image quality in photos due to dynamic lighting changes. Especially in dark bars where people would take photos all hours of the day. if the Photo Booth was in a location with natural light, the setting would go from very bright to very dark at night. The current solution was relying on the autoexposure that was built into the React Native Camera module we were using, and this approach would just try to even out the exposure across the entire frame, without giving priority to any part of the image. if there was a wide difference between different parts of the frame, it wouldn’t know how to reconcile that and would just try to find a mid point. In dark settings, this often would mean that faces would be very blown out. We talked about a way to improve this and this was a feature I was excited to take ownership of. One of the initial ideas we tossed around was providing more manual controls so that the Photo Booth manager could adjust the exposure based on the environment, but we quickly realized that this was departing from one of our core value propositions, a Photo Booth that was as hands off as possible to own and operate. I ended up proposing the idea of identifying faces and using those faces to do a spot exposure to ensure that the our subject matter was given priority over other features in the frame.

- After considering a couple different camera modules, and considering writing our own camera module from scratch suing native iOS code, I settled on modifying the existing camera module that we were currently using to add facial recognition and exposure to the existing library. The downside here was that we would be creating a fork of a library was continued to be in active development and that would mean we would either need to ensure continued compatibility of our work as the library evolved, or we would need to look at getting our work merged into the library itself. After looking at the amount of work to write the entire camera module from scratch to have full ownership, we decided it would be better to add on, rather than try to re- invent the wheel here.

- The first step for me was to really dissect how the module worked. This meant diving into the inner workings of the way that React Native works, mainly the way that it provides a bridge between the javascript that you would typically write, and the native iOS elements. Secondly this meant familiarizing myself more with Objective C (which I had never working with before) and the native iOS camera API. Grasping these two things allowed me to understand how the existing camera module worked, and from there I could begin looking at implementing our new feature.

- I had kept my eye on the Vision framework that Apple released in June of 2017, which brought robust facial recognition and object tracking. From there I began adding into the existing camera module and extending it to harness the facial recognition to identify all faces in the frame, doing a check to compare the sizes off all the faces to find the largest face, and then conducting a spot export on the center of the largest face.

- Getting the coordinate spaces correct, and translating coordinate spaces between facial recognition, the spot to expose the face, and different device orientations was the most difficult part of this process. As well as working with the Vision framework, which as a new library, did not have much good documentary and required a lot of digging around to find good examples, as well as struggling through Apples documentation, which I’m not really fan of.

- From there we sent it out into the wild and began testing. We came across some bugs where the tracking would fail if it lost a face mid shot. I ended up building a debug app where we could download already recorded videos, feed problematic ones into the app, and then replay the facial tracking with with overlays to determine exactly what the tracking was doing and where it was going wrong, and how we could optimize it.

- The final refinement involved fine tuning the logic around when it would revert to automatic exposure mode, and when it would look to establish and track a primary face, and how it would respond if that track was lost.

- In the end it was incredibly gratifying to compare before and after pics of some of the problematic locations, where the new photos were a night and day difference.


# What I'm looking for

- Strong engineering culture and with maturity. That doesn't mean how long its been around, but mature eng practices, processes. I've spent most of my career at companies where by nature of the stage, the priority has been on moving quickly. There are upsides to this from a learning perspective, but I'm also keen to spend time in with a team that has a bit more maturity within the eng org.
- Optimizng for growth opportunitiers. Really looking at being able to work alongside and learn from more experienced engineers.
- Strong product vision.


# Whats important to me in a workplace

- opportunities for growth and ownership. this continues to be the most important thing fro me anywhere i look. its seeking out engineering teams with a culture of learning and growth, of investing in each others learning. looking for teams with strong senior talent and a culture where engineers are invested in each othes growth and take the time to help each other. how collaborative the environment is, is a major barometer for me.
	- growth not just from a technical standpoint but also from a leadership standpoint. 
- the people. this one is simple, but im very relational and collaborative. especially given we are remote, the collaborative culure is very imporant. the best jobs for me have almost always been about the people i work alongside. looking for hungry, smart, humble. 
- looking for a chance to help shape the product and feel a sense of ownerhsip over what we building. im not drawn to opportunities where im just handed a set of requirements and expected to just sit infront of a screen and bang it out. i come from a creative background. the reason i choose the career path was rooted in a love for building and growing products. the ideal role for me is one where engineering feels a sense of ownership for the product and has a seat at the table for discussions around the product development and roadmap.


# Behavioral question answers

- My strengths
	- good collaborator, including going between technical and non- technical circles. i have experience working in client facing roles. i have experience working with technical and non- technical folks. ive done a lot of writing proposals, to pitching projects, to hiring creative teams. i think all these things have given me a strong ability to communicate and collaborate effectively with a broad group of people. honestly a lot of my closest friends come from places Ive worked at in the past and i think thats a testament to the fact that I really value strong realtionships in a workplace.
	- im a hungry, quick learner, good at picking up new technologies (chip on my shoulder, starting later) and becoming productive in a short timeframe. im a very curious person and i truly love the process of learning and growing in my craft. people who know me can attest to the fact that i spend a lot of time outside of my job continuing to work with technology.
	- thinking strategically about code / features / product in light of customer needs and product value. one of the things i loved about my time at photomadic and locus was how close we were to the end users of the product. i can be really effective on the product side and the technincal side. i think because of my diverse background, having spent a lot of time outside of a purely technical role I have a good sense for customer needs, aesthetics, user experience and ive learned and challenged myself to frame the technical work and feature development in light of the end product and customer experience.
	- bringing creativity to problem solving. pulling on my background as a professional creative to inject that same creative thinking, customer empathy, and problem solving to engineering problems


- weaknesses brainstorm
	- balancing opinion and conviction, with knowing when to give in and go with a direction i might not feel is smartest. picking the right battles.
	- working with others who are less engaged, passionate. coming from a previous career where you are only really in it if you love what you do.
	- being more suspicious of my instincts. the concept of the "killing zone", you are the most dangerous pilot between 100-200 hours. thats when you get past the initial stage of questioning all your abilities and being very conservative. and you begin to develop confidence, but you still don't have the depth of experience to account for all the variables- so a false confidence is the most dangerous thing
		- struggled with not being as skeptical about my own intuitions as I woudl naturally be. seeing past the bias towards the answer i want to get (thinking about the email digest issues). getting better at estimating times, planning for stuff to go wrong, ancitipating different working paces.
	- not getting too stuck in the weeds when solvig hard problems. keeping the big perspective in mind


- stepping outside of comfort zone
	- doing work in our data pipeline. working with raw SQL and titan.
	- jumping in to do native IOS objective c within a react native app. having only every done a little bit in my own time. jumping into a completely new IDE and archtecture.
	- using electron at locus. never having built a desktop app. I was losely familiar with Electron from a conceptual standpoint, and its great for JS developers because the UI and app logic are coded pretty much just as you would for the web. But it did bring a new set of challenges, things like handling code signing, handling app updates (and implementing an mechanism for over- the- air udpates), a new app lifecycle hooks and the electron ecosystem. 


- Moment of conflict or challenge with teammate / supervisor
	- (HIRING ALLYSON): this was a point of conflict between myself and our CTO. She was hoenstly not qualified, and to bring on an engineer who would have to learning to code on the job was something I was very much against (let alone a sister) for obvious reasons. I had a number of very open conversatios with the CTO (both of the founders were great about inviting honest conversations and we had great rapport), where I was able to tactfully but also honeslty voice my concerns. It became clear that she was going to be part of this team, so at that point I decided to accept that, and then focus on how to make the most out of the situation, how to set her up with the best chance to learn. No point in lettign it be a friction point or becoming bitter. Choose your battles, and then move on when its over. Dont' let it drag on. I think we were able to make the most out of having a VERY junior developer involved. She was able to contribute and make improvements. Still not the decision I would have ever made, but I think we did make the most out of it.
	- (BEING TO MUCH OF A "REALIST"): One of our product guys and I were at a startup event. On the way home, we were talking about or professional goals and personal growth. He asked if he could share some feedback and then brought up a discussion we had regarding when to launch the product, when it would be ready. He said he felt like I was being too negative about the state of the product and its readiness. He chalenged me to be a little more of an idealist and that thats an attitude that is necessary in startups. I took what he said to heart, and I could see how what he said was true. From there forward it became a bit of an inside joke, who was going to play the idealist and who was going to be the pragmatist. But I do lean heavily towards being bery pragmatic, and trying to plan for the worst case, and now I am tyring to balance that out with some healthy idealism.


- brainstrom for conflict / interpersonal issues
	- disagreeing with trying to a do a template launched version of react with reporting app vs doing an SPA. felt like i was the only one who was pushing back. probably pushed a little too hard. ended up deciding i made my case but the project lead really wanted a monlith and wanted to it all the djagno way.
	- feeling like james wasn't pulling his weight and like i was having to do double the work to get his stuff across the finish line on the frontend. he just straight up didn't come back from vacation with no communication. communicating with him, not letting stuff simmer. communicating with others to get more help. having to let people know that timelines would shift.



- brainstorm for failure examples / projects and how i handled it
	- overcommitting to what we could do in the emails for the digest revamp / redesign that i lead. i had not really had to tackle building emails before and neither had anyone on our team. i built a prototype and tested some the functionality (click to scroll and some layout aspects) and they worked in chrome. but when we got near to the full prototype- we found that there was limited cross browser compatibility. some of the navigation aspects were not going to be possible. there had even been a moment when one of the other engineers had said- hey, is this part something we can support? i ended up testing it in chrome and then circled back and said we are good. but i didn't thoroughly test it across all the browsers nor did i dig in enough to the client differences to know what a shit-show it is. 
		- i circled back with alex- you were right my bad. owned up to it, which included going back to our director of product and CTO and telling them i said we could do this, but here is why we can't, this is my fault for not catching this ealier. here is what we can do to try to solve this visually, without programmatic navigation.
		- i also ran into a bunch of visual errors. i got forwarded some clients emails that were super funky in outlook. i felt like this was my oversight and so i ended up pulling an allnighter to set up a email test suite across all clients. auditing and then brute forcing a fix and getting it out. 
	- another example over being over-ambitious in estimating the time invovled for developing the curation page. there were more backend dependencies and we had to push back our delivery date by 2 weeks (?).

- example of having to make a decision between two paths. how did i evaluate the options and pick which way to go?
	- approaches for convo import export
		- boolean query vs spreadsheet vs only in a UI
	- charting libraries
		- high level vs low level
	- tons of ui/ux tradeoffs to consider with the curation tool
		- WYSIWYG vs sidebar editing
