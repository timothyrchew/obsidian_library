# The Spiritual Element

There is a larger spiritual component to this scenario that I am missing.

In the face of my anxiety and deep seeded fear of bombing an interview and looking bad, I am giving into a compulsive preparation and worrying aimed and satiating the this toxic beast (fear of looking back, needing acceptance and validation from others).

I can think of this beast as something that has causing dysfunction just within this interview process. But when I step back, it is a beast that has had deep spiritual consequences in my faith througout the last decade, with singificant effects in my efforts to live in community and build honest relationships. This was part of why my marriage failed, and why my faith fell apart. 

It is God's desire and will that I excise this way of thinking, and the behavior that drives this kind of thinking. 

# The choice

Right now I could follow in my typical pattern- I could sideline everything else in my life and throw myself into cramming as much as I actually could in the hopes of minimizing the chances that I bomb the interviews. Even then, I'm unlikely to get even remotely prepared for the systems design interview, and there is still a very good chance of ending up with a question that I don't know how to tackle or design.

But the more damaging consequence of choosing this path is that I am feeding the beast, making it more powerful and controlling in my life. I am carving a path of behavior that solidifies this destructive patterns of thinking. I am shackling another chain in my mind that holds me bondage to living in fear of what others think about me, and being scared to fail or scared to not live up someone elses expectations or desires for me.


> For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ. Gal 1:10

I have a choice (and the opportunity to make many more choices between now and wednesday), to say no to this beast. To toss him asside and to starve him. He will still be there snarling at me, but he has no power on his own to hurt me. He is toothless, despite how scary and loud his snarls are. And each moment I do this, the beast gets just a little smaller. He may lash out and try to bite me. I feel the urge to recoil and to run away from him. It scares me. But if I leave out my hand and let him bite me, I find he has no teeth. I find that the thing I was so scared of has none of its own power. It turns out the power it has had over me was entirely the power I granted it, and that I have the ability to revoke that power and shrink and suffocate this beast little by little with each choice I make.

I've thought of the crucial moment as being the interview itself. I am scared of sitting down for an interview and coming up blank, falling short, looking incompetent, and being told I'm not good enough. I'm scared of failure. And I put all my focus on that moment. I give that moment the power, and therefor focus my efforts and doing everything within my power to avert that moment. 

In reality, the decisive moments that hold the true power are now. The interview is just the moment that the toothless beast will clamp down on me and I can see it has no power. The interview is the moment I can experiencially see that it has no power. The decisive moment feels like its then, but in reality it is right now. I can choose right now to acknowledge reality (it has no power over me, i have nothing to be scared of) and then to let the interview be a positive moment in where I see the beast truly has no teeth. 

# God's Role

I can know the facts. I can know that the beast is powerless and that it makes no sense to be scared of him. Left to my own, its is incredibly hard to change my thinking.

But the amazing reality is that I am not left to my own. This is an area where I can be completely assured and confident about what God wants. Its not about having to discern God's will, its about knowing fully what he wants for me and then choosing to stand in that place- safetly in his arms. 

I can come to Him again and again, asking him to help me change my patterns of thinking and asking him to help free me from this beast. 

As I walk forward into these next days, I can have the confidence God is in this with me and WILL work with me to being releasing me from this dysfunctional thought pattern.

# My truths and my prayers

The truth:
- God is in this. He brough this interview. He wants me to learn and grow. He knows my unprepared-ness and He knows what questions will be asked. He is asking me to let go of anxiety and fear, to be ok with failure, and to walk through this with him.
- This is the perfect learning opportunity: valuable free experience with absolutely no stakes.  Realistic practice and exposure are the ways in which I get better. Many people are willing to pay $100+ for a single session. Here I get the full interview cycle experience with smart engineers completely for free in a situation with no stakes. 
- Success is not me performing well in these tests. Success (and what is by far more valuable for me) is knowing that I will probably bomb this, yet releasing this into Gods hands and walking without anxiety or fear. Success is feeling moments of anxiety and feeling the tempation to try to compulsively get rid of it, but asking for help and then choosing to take hold of truth about the situation, about who I am, and about who God is to me.
- I am not trying to get this job. Everyone at the company can think I am a terrible programmer and I they would never want me on their team- and still this would have no effect on my life or career moving foward. I can absolutely bomb each interview and there will be absolutely no consequences. I can absolutely bomb this interview and there are no consequences.
- My abilities as an engineer are completely detached from my performance. I don't have to carry around any weight or need to validate my abilities through these interviews. The fact is I have not prepared, its fully in my capacity to get to the place where I can knock these out of the park. The only thing standing in my way is studying and practice. This is simply an initial benchmark that will kick off my journey towards truly being prepared and ready to make the circuit. 
- Failure is the best pathway to excellence. Everyone bombs interviews. The best way to get better at interviews is to fail interviews. Its just part of the grind of geting better. The important thing is to tackle these challenges head on, to not be scared of messing up or failing, but to focus on learning and brushing off the inevitable failed interviews that will happen along the way.

My prayers:
- God release me from the fear of failure, and the need to look good infront of others. Help me to rest in your arms when I feel scared or anxious. 
- God help me to see cleary the lies and the deceptions I am beleiving that are causing me to be afraid and to make bad choices. Help me to uproot these lies and to cast them asside.  
- I ask that you would use this experience to truly show me that I have nothing to fear. I ask that you would use this experience to truly help me to grow in the most valuable way, in my character and my experience of you. 
- I ask that as I face moments of anxiety and fear, both in the lead up and during the interviews, that you would grant me the strength and the focus to release it and to come running back to you and to truth.

# My commitment

- Stay rooted in my exercise, my spiritual time, and a balanced life. Prepare only at a pace that is within a reasonable range of what I will plan to do long terms. If I am going to set asside more time from study- do it from my free time. 
- When I feel anxiety or fear start to creep up, stop what I am doing ask God for help, and come review this document
- The goes is to let go of any need to do good at the interviews, but to aim to fail and even bomb it with the goal of failing without giving in to anxiety and fear. Go ahead and expect that I will probably bomb the systems design one. Remember that they value for me is in the experience of failing and learning in a way that is going to make a lot more effective in the long term.
- Take time to visualize bombing the interview. Do the stoic practice of experienceing, living in it, and seeing that it is not that bad. Also practice visualizing this with the right mentallity, not being afraid. Get some virtual practice runs in.

# Therapy notes

Inner peace / Serenity is the state I want to root in

My safe place:
- Go to Austria. Sit on the porch. Feel the chill of the mountain breeze, feel the warmth of the sun on my skin, breathe in the fresh mountain air. Soad in the grandeur of the mountain peaks around me. Hear the rustle of the wind through the trees.
- Hear the words “Rooted”. Ground myself in the serenity of this place. As the fear or anxiety creeps in, come back and choose to plant my roots into this scene. Feel the fear and anxiety fade away.
- The lizard is there, off at the edge of the garden, but I am choosing to stay rooted and to not let him affect my experience here
- "I will learn from this experience". The goal for me is not to do well at the interview, it is to learn as much as I can and to be ok with bombing an interview. The goalposts are different for me, they are not what they look like they are. The goalposts are actually very different- to let the experience of failing an interview wash over me without affecting me, and to learn from this process.
- Visualize the movie playing out. And practice the process of grounding myself, hear the words "rooted", and remember what my goal is. Let the fear or the interview responses roll off my back, painlessly. They have no power and no lasting consequence past this 1 hour. 
- Its ok to say I don't know. I don't have to manifest the ability to do this. I will give it my best shot, but at the end of the day the words "I don't know" are something I can always fall back on without feeling bad whatsoever.
