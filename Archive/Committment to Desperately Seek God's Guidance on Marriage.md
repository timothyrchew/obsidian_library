My commitment and utmost priority over my life over the next 2 months. I can't afford to waste a single day. Work comes second.

Prayer
- Spend some time in repentence, surrender, and commitment to God
- Pray through a specific list of things begging God for his guidance and help. 
- Pray for Lara, her journey, her protection

Reflection
- Journal through specific prompts that I've identified

Counsel / Community
- Seek the wisdom and guidance of others
- Read a book about processing a divorce and remarriage

Collective Intention
- Talk boldly and intentionally with each other about our relationship
- Seek steps forward together in faith and service
