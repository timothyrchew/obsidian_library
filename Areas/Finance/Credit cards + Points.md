# Next steps

Prio:
- plan out the specific trips lara and i, or i would take and orient all miles accumulation around those specific goals since that could shape the order in which acquire points
- look for other good deals mom and dad could use to get back in biz. consider giving dad a rundown on tactics.
- figure out if i should go for citi aa biz next, how to balance biz cards with personal cards in terms of best sequencing. do a broader look at how to best pace myself, how to maintain good credit score and keep this sustainable on personal and business side.
	- right now the biggest ding is hard inquries. look more at whether this matters, how much it will impact.
- keep an eye on whether i would want to lower my credit limit with chase or any of my current cards
- get remaining chase business cards:
	- chase ink preferred (if deal pops up in next couple months, or consider using this for wedding spend)
- use last two 5/24 spots:
	- aeroplan
	- world of hyatt
	- united explorer

- united quest / explorer


# Sustainable approach

Sign up bonuses
- space out for 3-4 per year
- on concerns about running out of cards to churn:
	- can recycle offers at 24 month mark for almost all but amex
	- can count on new cards to be rolled out, or changes to cards that allow to re-apply
	- if i do start running out of cards, i will likely be sitting on a shit ton of miles to last me a while

Use strategic organic spend to maximize points accumulation

Keep Lara under 5/24, go over myself

Follow practices to avoid getting flagged / shut down (do more research here, lots of good info out there...especially on redit)
- Identify no / low AF cards that I will carry indefinitely for the benefits. Keep average credit card account age up.

Minimize AF fees
- Be careful about tracking and shutting down AF cards that I will not be utilizing. Get as close to the full year, make sure that I am keeping the points.
- Be careful to actually utilize the benefits of cards, especially AF card have benefits to offset the AF.

Business spend / manufactured spend
- ***Likely never worth it for me purely for points, need to be very careful here in terms of ROI: likely much better return on rewards by actually focusing this time investing in career growth and increasing salary
- Buying groups (https://www.pointsprofessor.co/buying-groups-for-credit-card-points-reviews/#Why_you_should_join_a_buying_group)
- Reselling / Bot snipping
- Think about passive web dev startup fun ideas
- Pay rent with plastiq using promo for reduced fees
