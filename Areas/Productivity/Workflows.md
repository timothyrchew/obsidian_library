    - what did i plan for today?
    - whats one thing I'm going to start right now?
- checkout:
    - what did i accomplish (celebrate)
    - is there anything i need to do right now to be able to dissengage?
    - when do i need to do the things I didn't get done today (do these trickle and does this need to change week plans)?
- Morning routine
    - don't look at reddit or news
    - shower: listen to audiobook or podcast
    - do some stretches, yoga
    - meditation / prayer
    - coffee
    - 10 minute checkin

    - (do day planning if I missed this previous day)
    - identify clear goals for workday
    - block distractions (use pomodoro?)
- Work check-out
    - leave breadcrumbs for whatever is unfinished
    - do day planning for tomorrow
    - 15 min checkout

- No Motivation Routine (When I have goals set for myself, but I'm tired and I'd rather play video games)
    - get out of the space I am currently in, go on a walk, step outside, clear my head and do the following steps
    - remember the why. why are the goals I set important? what is the cost if I don't pursue them?
    - give myself the permission to call it a day, to not go to work. it is my choice to weight and make. does taking a break now and coming back to work later make more sense
    - (flesh out steps to get into flow state)
    - remember that if i push through the initial wall and acheive flow, the work is goign to be become much more rewarding and i will feel better about myself than if i cave in a veg out
- Cold Start Routine (Having fallen off the bandwagon, or coming back after multi-day hiatus)
    - recognize that this will happen and accept it as normal and part of the process. just get back up and carry on.
    - start at a high level (week planner) and scaffold the next couple days based on whats top of mind. don't worry about clearing inboxes, that can come later once im back on track.
    - build my daily planner
    - identify if there was anything in my control that led to my getting derailed, and determine what I can do to avoid next time
