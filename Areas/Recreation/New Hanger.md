# DEEP DIVE AIRPLANES (as of 10/21)

aim:
- oss is awesome because it gives me the chance to tinker and learn about coding simulations and the platforms themselves. lower quality is ok if i can tinker and look under the hood. (SEE Game Dev for more OSS focus and dev notes)
- tradeoffs between fun and realistic are fine- aim for rewarding experiences.
- don't worry about being exhaustive, look for decent coverage across major aircraft categories and worthwhile platforms.

scope:
- represents current focus, not exhaustive of all quality aircrat i have access to. may contain newer aircraft not in my "quality airplane, full list" below. when removing an aircraft from this list, consider archiving it under "full list" below.

# **—OVERVIEW—**

Main goals:

-Get to enjoy and experience things I wouldn’t otherwise (get taste/insight into different types of flying.)

-Hone real world skills + work on ratings

-Learn to develop useful training/simulations (build the skillset to build anything I want)

TRAINING

-work through ratings and practice real world procedures in a way that boosts my real world skills and training

ACTIVE

-planes/projects/ratings that I am narrowing my focus on now to learning deeply.

-next flights to take for fun, rotating cast of airplanes that are just fun to fly casually.

-subset of aircraft that are installed, configured and read to fly now.

-can be a rotating cast, should not be more than i can be currently proficient at.

HANGAR

-Reasonable breath of aircraft types that provide a foundation to explore different types of operation/engineering (not focused on specific sim airplanes. but must have at least 1 i can fly).

Overview

-On quantity: your understanding increases significantly for the 1st type, and then the 2nd type allow you to better understand weaknesses and strengths and broader concepts. By the 3rd of a similar thing, the insights are diminishing. when learning multiples of a type, consider western vs foreign types.

-On quality: Go deep, don’t get fixated on breadth. Depth will pay bigger dividends in terms of understanding procedures and operation more than knowing ho two flip switches in a couple dozen aircraft. VR allows me to truly enjoy more of the sensation and experience of piloting these planes, so it only makes sense to go deeper because more the depth is there now

-On evolution: The focus is on getting to understand how to operate each type of aircraft. As new planes come out, this can revolve. This list is just to help me spread my attention onto key different aircraft that will expose me to new aspects, technology, operation.

ROLES

-Reasonable breath of pilot roles that provide a foundation to explore different mission/trip profiles and training types.

Overview

-On operations: to assume the role’s of different types of flying, through exploring the training, preparation, procedures, environments that encompass the day to day life and job of these types of pilots. The aspect is focused less on the peculiarities of a certain type of aircraft, and more how that aircraft is put to work. The context within which the aircraft is done and the mission it accomplishes (in some sense, the difference between DCS, a deep simulation of a plane, and BMS a simulation of what it is like to be a fighter pilot in a war).

-On aircraft: these should generally utilize aircraft in the hangar above. But it is also ok to venture outside of those when it servers to better explore the in and out of a role.

Training:

-Instrument

-HP/Complex

-Commercial

-CFI

-Multi

---

# **ACTIVE**

**When going to fly:**

-Work through the queue incrementally

**Adding to queue:**

-Go depth over breadth. Look for specific learning goals / scenarios / destinations / campaign that will take me deeper and learning new things.

**Adding to next:**

-Focus on my active aircraft. When I have baseline of proficiency, I can add aircraft outside this core group.

-Aim for at least one thing from civilian, military, space, dev in the Next queue at each point.

**Updating active aircraft:**

-I can swap these out at any point, but don’t have more than I can stay proficient at with longer breaks between flying. Goal is to make sure I have a stable that I am good with even when I get really busy and can’t fly as much, ensuring I can keep things enjoyable by just jumping in and flying.

**Questioning this structure/system or obsessing over cohesion:**

-Take a step back, ponder my life vision statement and goals. Let that sink in. Come back and read the top "Overview" section and then decide if I really need more detail or specificity.

**Organization:**

-Inbox. A place to quickly drop ideas, planes, flights, things to learn or accomplish. Things from here get processed into the boxes below.

-Active aircraft. Collection to stay proficient on at a given time.

-Queues. Mix of types of flights that are interesting and I’d like to do.

-Next. Aggregation of queues into a single list that I can pick from when I sit down to fly.

-need to manually enable VR zoom (turned off by default)

-turn off chaseplane app in order to prevent it from overriding VR zoom feature

-need to set panel transparency to 100 to hide PMDG panels in VR

-Context: unlike some other sims, it feels like turning graphics down all the way doesn't lead to as much of a boost due to the fact that complex aircraft and cockpits are bulk of the load, and still get rendered high quality even with stuff turned down.

-Settings (as very basline for smoothest fps, can selectively turn up settings from here):

-Can consider locking framerate to 30 if it flucuates a lot

-FXAA on, 2xMSAA

-Medium textures

-World, all low but Scenery Complexity set to medium

-All lighting off, all shadows off

-All weather minimum, simple clouds, no volumetric fog

-Single pass vr

-Oculus tray tool: 

-turn up super sampling (makes image look sharper). 

-ASW ON. Causes a framerate drop (around 22-24 fpts), but actually looks smoother than turning it off and getting a framerate boost (30 fps).

XPL VR

-***IMPORTANT: Visual effects needs to be set to High (HDR) in order to see mouse cursor (as of Sep 16th, 2020)

-Visual plugins: 3jFPS + OVR-Settings

-Settings (Sep 16th, smooth and looks great)

-Enable Vulcan! (this makes a signficant difference compared to OpenGL)

-Visual effects: High (HDR)

-Texture Quality: High

-Anti-aliasing: 2x SSAA+FXAA (this one really makes stuff look much better)

-Anistropic Filtering (4x)

-Number of World Objects: High

# NAV Systems Ref

XPLANE FMC
- manual: https://x-plane.com/manuals/FMS_Manual.pdf

DETAILED VNAV UNDER THE HOOD EXPLANATION:
https://developer.x-plane.com/article/autopilot-vnav-modes-and-planemaker-settings/

VNAV:
- RNAV approaches with default FMC in X-Plane 11: Philipp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=todY3eLQDU4
- X-Plane G1000: VNAV: Philipp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2chCP1XObek
- X-Plane 11 default FMC VNAV Tutorial: Herka-Jerk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMWeAI6eH-M

- flight plan setup
	- must set cruise altitude on the CRZ page
	- remove discontinuities from flight plan
	- ensure that PROG page should distances and TOD
	- ensure that legs page shows descent arrows and altitudes next to each waypoint
	- if not showing, can activate altitude via direct page, or delete any discontinuities. ensure that CRZ altitude is correct in FMS and AP panel.
- engage vnav for climbout. Should be in VALT mode.
- vnav still be engaged prior to TOD. set alitude capture to lower alt. once passing TOD, ap should start descending via dynamic VS / VPATH.
	- May need to V/S mode, AP can control V/S speed sometimes without activating that mode when reaching TOD.
- can "activate" a VNAV descent leg by going to "direct" page, and clicking to the right of a waypoint (on the altitude value), and confirming to modify plan

—

MSFS Default FMC / G3000 / G1000

Limitations:

-Can fully create and edit flight plans manually in cockpit, with the exception of approach waypoints. Approaches can be selected and changed, but the waypoints themselves can't be adjusted.

-Can only fly direct to non-approach waypoints. However you can manually type in the direct-to waypoint of an approach fix to activate. On Garmin units, its also possible to activate approach, and your your next waypoint becomes the first point of the approach. I don't think there is currently an equivalent for the airliners FMC.

-Cannot set altitude / speed constraints

---

# BMS Controls

Preferred Method:

-Use Alternative Launcher to map HOTAS commands + speed brakes + wheel brakes. Use a single shifted state set to “Pinky / DX Shift”. Make sure to set a release value for DX Shift, otherwise pressing shifted once will remained shifted and throw off all subsequent key presses. Once I’ve generated the keyfile (Alternative launcher will always save it to “BMS - Full”, I can then save that keyfile and use it independently of the launcher in the future if I want).

[https://github.com/chihirobelmo/FalconBMS-Alternative-Launcher/releases](https://github.com/chihirobelmo/FalconBMS-Alternative-Launcher/releases)

Options to Edit:

-use BMS natively

-use alternative Launcher

-use keyfile editor app (from source forge)

-use excel sheet editor app

-edit the keyfile in plain text

Existing Profiles to use:

-[https://www.benchmarksims.org/forum/showthread.php?37942-Thrustmaster-T-16000M-TWCS-Keyfile](https://www.benchmarksims.org/forum/showthread.php?37942-Thrustmaster-T-16000M-TWCS-Keyfile)

Resources on Setting Controls / Keyfiles:

-BMS-Techical-Manual + BMS-Manual (Super deepdive and should be bible for all of this)

-[http://www.blu3wolf.com/falconbms/Kolbe/Falcon BMS Keyfile Manual.pdf](http://www.blu3wolf.com/falconbms/Kolbe/Falcon%20BMS%20Keyfile%20Manual.pdf)

Notes on T16000m + TWCS;

-To set axis, leave device on whatever is set initially (or keyboard) and then go into "advanced" to set the axis for joystick and throttle. For some reason, changing the device to either joystick can sometimes prevent me from using axis from both devices. If its working, I should see all the joystick and throttle axis working from the main controls screen. (issue described here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit/comments/4rycbi/bms_throttleflight_stick_configuration_trouble/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit/comments/4rycbi/bms_throttleflight_stick_configuration_trouble/))

-Part 10 Chuck guide (part 52), firing a weapon. Pick weapon on DSMS. arm weapon and sensors. select delivery mode (CCIP/ CCRP). Make sensor SOI. move SPI over target. slave sensors to SPI, and lock it. Fire weapon.

-master mode hotas button to switch to guns

-UHF radio is for talking to Flight, Wingman, ATC

-VHF AM is for talking to air and ground units.

-VHF FM is for talking to JTAC

Mig21

-Let engine fully spool up before turning on avionics, radio, radar. Otherwise stuff can break. Let radar warm up for 5 minutes or it can break.

-radar basics in chucks guide (part 8, page 49).

-infrared guided missle. configure switches based on page 54. put radar in search mode. slew TDC with (O / N key). ENTER key to lock target. When in range, fire weapon.

-bombs, configure switches to page 62. then gain altitude, dive steeply, and drop on piper.

-PUT GEAR IN NEUTRAL after takeoff or will have depleted hydraulics pressure after landing.

Mirage

-tanker frequency in my mission is 251 AM

-Radar needs 3 minute warmup before it ready, PCH mode.

-Waypoints in mission editor get loaded in as INS waypoints.

-Must align INS, follow steps in Chucks guide (page 46). Right shift K to open kneeboard, and then “]” to cycle to page that gives me the starting lat/long that I can align with.

-Make sure to warm up Missle before shooting. Push so that it shoes a blinking P (warming up) and wait until it shows a solid “P” on the PPA panel.

-“Green” radio is back radio (V/UHF), “Red” is forward one (UHF)

-Green radio power is PAL or PAL+G. Red Radio is “M” position for power.

-good startup tutorial: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxK9SPqrQog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxK9SPqrQog)

-Key to flying this thing is understanding the autopilot. Good overview: [http://www.simhq.com/_air13/air_426a.html](http://www.simhq.com/_air13/air_426a.html).

-Autopilot tutorial ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7dEDryGlUE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7dEDryGlUE))

-navigation tutorial ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPHqdLXpMx8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPHqdLXpMx8))

-Certain HUD data might be missing at beginning due to not letting INS align. It should appear after couple minutes.

-Navigation (great detailed steps Chuck guide page 82). Load waypoints into mission editor. Use keypad to select waypoint 1, engage at least bank, pitch, heading hold on autopilot, and then turn on route following on collective switch. autopilot will follow the waypoints.

-Re-engage waypoint navigation for route following autopilot, need to hit WPT button to turn off current mode, then WPT again with waypoint number to get it to show lat long. Once lat long is visible it means WPT mode is active again.

-Using the Vikhr air-ground missile (chuck page 65)

-to auto-hover, need to bring helicopter into mostly a hover position, then engage. fd/ap button should not be engaged but all others can be.

-bit test hold down Y key

-Depressing TDC will lock radar screen to narrow sliver. Depress again to go back to scanning. Use undesignated to release target when locked to return to scanning.

Harrier

-Good video series ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJBPRZMM-8U&list=PLml_c09ciucvv3CIsWImCEqY5XIdbfPxu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJBPRZMM-8U&list=PLml_c09ciucvv3CIsWImCEqY5XIdbfPxu))

-Difference between DMT and TGP: DMT is close integrated into the aircraft and the HUD and actually dropping weapons. The TGP is tacked on primary as a way to identify and lase targets. But it is not as closely linked.

-Use DMT for targeting unguided bombs, or to pick up laser point (chuck page 100)

-Use TPOD to lase a target (chuck page 103)

-Undesignate target in order to drop CCIP or to center the TPOD / DMT

-Maverick guide (chuck page 128).

-Laser guided bomb: Take TGP out of standby. Start with undesignated target point on nose. Slew TDC over point. Select LASER and then select FIRE. No need to designate target. Then Put bomb in Auto mode, set fuzing to anything, and then fly over mark and hold pickle to drop.

-Firing weapons (chucks guide page 76)

-For radio communications, make sure “Intercom” switch is NOT turned on on top left side panel. This will force intercom even when my radio panel is set to “RADIO”.

P-51

-Easy startup, follow built in training mission or chuck guide (page 27)

Yak1 (IL2)

-tactics: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-aC5lNYU-8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-aC5lNYU-8)

-Lean mixture at altitude

-Can fly at max power in combat, but keep oil and water doors open just enough to keep Oil and Water under 100C

-Use Supercharger over 2500m

TBM

-vnav descent: hover over the altitude constraint and press enter to activate it as the next constraint to follow.

Q400

-make sure to use enroute VNAV and not VTO (which seems to be a little buggy). Active VNAV by clicking on "TO" and then picking the waypoint, rather than clicking into VTO.

-make sure to turn nosewheel steering switch on (on cap panel next to tiller)

Constelation

-Reduce power at 13,000 for the VFE to engage superchargers

717

-need to close isolation valve so that all APU air goes to 1 engine otherwise start will fail

-press "autoflight" button prior to takeoff to arm autothrottles. advance them past certain threshold and it will engage takeoff thrust. then after liftoff, press "autoflight" again to engage autopilot.

Concorde (colimata):
- Full flight with Vatsim example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmHR3VlK34E&ab_channel=104th_Maverick
- can use engineer to power up and start engines
- IMPORTANT: prompt the engineer to set the fuel balance for each stage. the aircraft will not climb right without this!
- Flight plan
	- can load into the G1000 popup. then i can navigate with nav source set to "INS" and from the G1000 flight plan.
- Takeoff: 
	- set trim to 2. nose tends to rise up early otherwise.
	- IAS hold does not work right for climbing, it wont pitch nose high enough so plane will keep gaining speed early on. once at higher alt it works fine. should use pitch / vertical speed for early climb.
- Climb:
	- Reheats off around 2500
	- Climb full throttle to FL280
	- Stay at Mach .95 until ready to go supersonic.
	- Rheats on and MAX climb. Set Alt aquire to 60k.
- Descent:
	- start descent 200 miles out. 100 miles to get down to subsonic cruise at FL280. 100 miles to for subsonic (normal) approach down to landing.
	- SLOWLY close throttle to 18 degrees. Wait to see 360 knots and then set ias hold to start decsent. keep throttle at 18 degrees to MACH 1.5
	- Can pull throttle to back to 32 degrees until MACH 1. Can go idle from here if needed.
	- Keep speed at 350kts as long as possible rest of the way.
- Landing:
	- Landing speed 180kt
	- keep autothrottle on all the way down to 100 ft
	- After touchdown, idle reverse, get nose down, then apply reverse thrust.
- Colimata manuals:
	- 10 essentials has high level overview of the flight regimes
	- cold and dark startup walks through everything up unitl takeoff
	- nav tutorial walks through high level overview of everything from takeoff to landing
	- (still looking for full flight manual the pirate sites)
- FSLabs
	- Has great detailed walkthrough full flight, can use this as a realistic concorde reference
