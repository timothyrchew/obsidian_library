# Framework gaming

- Have fun

- Aim for games that can teach some real life skills

- Learn more about creativity and programming through the mod scene, or building my own games as a hobby

- There are infinite good interesting games. Don't focus on needing to try everything, just aim to find a balance with the gaming time I do spend: have fun and also put it towards games that add some benefit to the rest of my life: via developing useful skills or knowledge.

# Organization

## inbox: 

- this is where i can drop new games that im interesting in adding to backlog or "next" list

## backlog:

- this is my categorized "shelf" of games. it consists both of new game that I'm setting aside to play sometime or it can be games that have ive tried or have been in my rotation, but im relegating back for another time, but not ditching them.

## purchased:

- games that i own, organized by category. these will be parallel to (in function, they both are collections to pull from in building my "next" list) the backlog, but set aside because I do already own them and i want to make i tracked owned software.

## in rotation:

- duplicate of games, not source of truth

- the top tier games that i want to keep playing regularly.

## next:

- duplicate of games, not source of truth

- this is my immediate list of things to play next. when i set down to play, i shouldn't have to deliberate i should just pull off this list. if this list runs low, i fill it from a combination of "in rotation", backlog, and purchased collections.

## (game specific next lists):

- i can keep more detailed game/genre lists like i do for fsim (that gets more in the weeds, flying specific flights between cities, specific tasks). the global next list can contain either the generic step (ie "play fsim"), which then means i can go look at the fsim game notes to see what ideas i had put down earlier. or it can contain the more specific step if it is something distinct that is that was a clear part of what i wanted to accomplish or experrience when i had the inspiration to put this down, as opposed to just thinking "well it would be cool to do someting flight sim related".
