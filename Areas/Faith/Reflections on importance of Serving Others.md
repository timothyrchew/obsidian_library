It was right after the dinner where my family met Lara's parents. As we were wrapping up and leaving, this happened in the parking lot.

a struggling soul, just trying to fix his bicycle in the parking lot. worried about missing a work in his first week at goodwill. paying 100 a week for a room in a house. sitting at eating dry ramen and some juice in the parking lot. pulling a small cart behind his bike.  
  
and he initially approached me, but i wasn't really paying attention and got in my car before i could hear what he wanted (and in my mind, i assumed he was just asking for money). but because dad stopped and listened, he was able to really help this guy in this moment. and even as i went to pick up the wrench from autozone, i was still doing it out of obligation and wanting to be quickly done so i could leave.  
  
lord have mercy on me. forgive me for my selfishness. forgive me for my fixation on my own time, my own comfort, my own space.  
  
would you make me more aware of how you are asking me to be your hands and feet to the least of these. would you grow me to be more empathetic, more loving, more sacrificial on behalf of those in need, that you love so deeply. would you soften my heart and my pre-occupation with my own little world.

my life is so self centered. so privileged. so filled with wealth and indulgence. i desperately need to stretch myself to love and to care and to serve the least of these. as my life might not look radically like what i once thought, i mustn't lose sight of what i absolutely know is so central and so pivotal to faith and following God. loving and caring and serving the least of these.   
  
i can be struggling with hypocrisy in the church. i can be struggling the theology. i can be doubting. but at the end of the day i am going to follow God and I need to keep centering myself in his call. and this is 100 percent certain- its to radically sacrifice my time and my resources for those around me. its to learn to see the face of jesus in these people. its to be the hands and feet of jesus to them.  
  
think seriously. pray about this. and make this a central thing to explore and take steps forward in with lara. this is probably THE WAY that i answer the question about her willingness to live the lifestyle and embrace the changes that God would most likely ask of me- to be willing to love and care and sacrifice for the least of these.
