Meyers Brigg:

INFP (Mediator) root type, but I think I have evolved to more TJ as I've gotten older.
INFJ (advocate) type scores high and seems to capture some very speific unique things about me

Bekah thinks 3w4, which in stress would act like a 9.


Interesting case studies to see how I was doing when I was healthy / unhealthy:
- how i responded in the wake of my divorce. how i navigated splitting up the estate with jenn.
- how i handled the family situation with the rules about Zeke
- how I handled settling in at Bond, responding when Koty joined
- how my relationships and feelings evolved over the course of my time at Yonder. what it was like when i started, what it was like when i decided to leave.
- how I approached the situation with Renji, considering the possibility of joining immersed
- how i behaved on the mirlan trip, the e3 around the world trip
- the motivation behind my connection to playing and writing music throughout highschool and college. what connected me to storytelling and film.
- how i operated at the galvanize bootcamp, the sense of connecting to the drive, coming alive, loving the experience
- consider how i behave when im stressed at work, throwing all else asside and making work a complete priority at the expense of my personal life and relationshis
- consider that i almost need weed to actually unwind and let go. that i have a lot of trouble doing this without weed.
- consider how i love giving advice, ill happily call out things that i think could be better, or our team is doing wrong, or individuals could improve at. in a safe space, i don't hold back there. but id prefer to not tell them directly, id prefer to tell a third party.
