Be humble, filled with grace, and without judgement to others in their walk and expressions of faith, seeking to help them take a step towards God in their journey.

Be fervent, intentional, pure in heart, and continually seeking to live out and obey whatever God would speak to me, however hard or narrow of a path it might be.
