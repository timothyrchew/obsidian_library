Work:

I didn't want to re-engage about that opportunity unless I felt a pretty serious sense that it would be the right fit, and just hadn't gotten there. 

I feel good about where I am, and the life balance and a clear sense this is the right speed to make space to encounter God. I still have desires to get back into a high impact role in an early stage startup but it will need to be a more clear sense and pull that its time. I don't have that yet. 

I just switched jobs- happy with my role right now. Honestly man, its great compensation, generous equity. Interesting upside in the company. Some really smart coworkers, the thing that is always the same is how important it is for me to be growing and getting challenged at work. Doing full stack work, having impact, and see lots of room for growth in this company.


Faith:

- Lots of healing, lots of rebuilding man. I'm really thankful for this last year, and I feel like I really turned a corner when it comes to my faith.


Making sense of past communities and my faith heritage
- I've wrestled a LOT with the faith communities Ive been part of for a large part of the past decade. The vast majority of that was in heavily reformed circles.
- I wrestled with a lot of questioning the nature of church, a lot of cynicism. Really felt like I didn't fit the mold. Was really dissolusioned with how I saw faith lived out, a lot of it felt phony, performative, insular, disconnected from messiness and the nuance of life. In a lot of ways I was ashamed to be associated with it. 
	- Its not somewhere I felt like I would want to bring someone who is exploring faith, or questioning things, or who is going through a real hardship. I didn't feel like church would make life better. It would provide a social circle, it could provide some routines, but beyond that what does it really have to offer.
- In some sense I really needed distance from that to reset. Re-evaluate. To explore some different expressions of the christian faith. Understanding that church tradition, the course of christian history is so much broader an umbrella than I ever realized. 
	- From my time within Reformed tradition, there was this real sense of pride and almost this self-righteousness about "right theology". We hold claim that, these things are indisputable, hold the line, if you don't see things this way, go read this verse.
	- There was time in life where that worked for me. Even though i sound disparaging, there are plenty of people that can thrive in that settting. That is great. There is real sense of security, clarity, structure that exists, and can be a really comforting thing. Where I used to by cynical and a bit harsh, 
- But when things fell apart, as I started questioning. I didn't feel like there was the space, grace, or openess to do that safetly within those walls. And there is this real sense that I don't fit in here, and I'm scared I won't find a spiritual home. Its a very lonely place.

New life
- For me gift has been discovering that the bredth of Christian expression, and God's work is so much broader than the very narrow Reformed tradition. And I think there are some unique strengths within that theology and worldview, but I think there are also some pretty significant weaknesses and blind spots. 

- Its been revitalizing to discover other chrsitian expressions, traditions. I feel like I've encountered God being nearer to me, much more personal, much more present. 
- And a sense of validation, that there are actually a lot of people that have gone through similiar things. That its ok to doubt. That there can be this time of reckoning that you walk through, that doesn't lead to losing your faith, but that can lead to a much deeper, more intimate, experience of God. 

During peak covid, I took the time to check out more church virtually. This was also the time when I started really engaging and exploring more with my girlfriend. So it was important to me to find a place that we could both connect to. Coming at it from either ends- for her from a Jewish perspective exploring Christian faith, for me- having felt really burned. Ready to actually engage.
- Its been great to find a community that comes from quite a different perspective. I certainly don't agree with everything, but I have really felt a sense of belonging in this community that is openly this collection of misfits- people that have been burned, or exlcuded by the church. And there has been a real sense of openness, and come as you are, lets dig in and hash out our questions, or struggles together. And its far from perfect. There are certainly aspects of the more progressive side that I do see as real weaknesses. But at this stage, its been a very safe place for us both to connect. And we've met a couple people that have been a huge blessing to both her and I in walking through this stage. 
- I hold on all this stuff much looser than I used to. This is where I am for now.
