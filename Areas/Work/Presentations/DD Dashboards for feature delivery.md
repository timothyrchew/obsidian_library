Two goals:
- Feature dashboards
	- Tracking feature impact via a DD dashboard
	- Touching on some monitoring

Intention:
- visibility and monitoring are part of "feature complete"
- the easiest way for us to better track and impact of a given feature, another way to demonstrate engineering value. broadcasting wins, especially around eng work that can be less visible. a one stop place to pull together work and impact that spans multiple codebases.
	- there are lots of other, more sohpisticated ways to do this. but DD is a low lift approach that should take no more than 30 min to setup, once you have some key metrics.
- help mitigate the impulse to ship and run
- helps us keep the "why" front and center as we ship code. 

Aspects:
- Answering the question how do we know this is delivering value
- Consolidate key metrics / KPIs in a single easy to access view
- Relevant PD alerting should be part of new feature development
- Pull in data from across codebases in one place


Monitoring:
- full stack tracing
- custom user actions
- session replay
