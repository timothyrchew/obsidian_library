Feedback from Ted:
- on the topic of increasing velocity
	- go broad: reach out to other teams and insert myself where there is need (as will be the case, specifically when lohika leaves and other teams lose FE engineers)
	- go deeper into BondOS, look out further ahead. look for ways to improve strategically, from a product and eng side.
	- work with product to pick up the pace. to help knock out unknowns. to start answering engineering questions early.

Prio:
- Impressions / feedback for onboarding:
	- I felt very welcomed, everyone was really gracious and happy to help. Very appreciative of that.
	- The first two weeks were very unstructured and open ended. I had videos to watch and was told to just familiarize myself with the codebase. 
		- the lunch and learns, the documntation has been more thorough than past companies, those were great resources.
		- There are different learning styles, I'm of the mentality that the best way to get ramped up is to start tackling real work as soon as possible. I think pairing on a real feature even the first day would be a good way to chance the oboarding. 
- General questions:
	- Interested to hear from your perspective, from the executive team, an assesement around engineering velocity if we are meeting expectations. if expecations are being met, or where there might be disconnects. What would you see as the bottlenecks?
		- Related:
			- addressing that some teams seem really stretched, others have more bandwidth. 
				- any openness to fluid teams, or migrating engineers? or a tour of duty across different teams?
					- feels like teams a bit silod. i would certainly would be excited to know more about what other teams are doing, the key problems they are tackling within their domain. and gaining more insight into the broader application and platform.
				- any openness to encouraging more full stack engineers?
	- How does the engineering team generally communicate progress out to the broader team, how do they celebrate wins on a larger scale? Communicating the why behind the word we do.
		- Can bring up the dashboard about the user journey, considering that part of the self-signup updates. Trying to measure impact in a more tangible way.
	- What would you like to see more from the brand experience team? How can we be more effective and more impactful?

Discussion topics
- be prepared to share my impressions of how my adjustment has been
	- felt very welcomed- everyone has been gracious and happy to help.
	- a lot of really smart people, and so generally really excited to learn from others, to be in the trenches, to contribute in as many was as i can.
	- im really happy to be here, excited about the opportunity and anxious to start grinding
	- onboarding
		- pretty unstructured and open ended- i tend to learn by being hands on. so i sought out some work to pick up, most tackling tech debt while product finished getting feature work ready. i think having some small feature work queued up would be a good thing to help new folks find their footing.
		- recorded lunch and learns was really helpful resource in getting familiar with the product and the industry
- Philosophy of backend vs frontend, team composition. Encouraging more full stack work so that individual teams and shift and morph more to the work thats on the table. Thats been more of my background in the past and thats worked well for nimble teams- everyone is specialized, but aims to be competent across the stack. (T shaped expertise)
	- Can touch on how I've picked up some more backend tickets this past week.
- Curious to hear more about how they structured the specific teams and decided about resource allocation. I know that this re-org happened I think the week or two before I joined. 
	- my observation 
		- things have felt quite silod, don't have much visibility into what is happening outside the brand experience team. 
		- he menitoned at our fortnight review that there seems to be some teams that are underwater, while BREXP currently has the bandwidth to focus on tackling tech debt. 
	- suggestions / questions:
		- Would we consider shifting engineers around within teams more fluidly as needs arise?
		- Woudl we consider rotations, a tour of duty for engineers as a way to get more familiar across the product and eng teams?
- How do distinct engineering teams communicate and celebrate progress out to teams?
	- Could we do a better job at celebrating wins? I know I definitely don't have a great sense for what those wins are in other eng teams.
- The product / eng feedback loop has felt slow
	- I don't have a large sample size, but we see an initial PRD and then 2 weeks later we are still waiting for it to be "ready". We could possibly break this down into smaller, more iterative approach. Don't even have to release incrementally. But it feels like we could parallelize this work. Maybe product could break things down into smaller pieces or foundational elements that could unlock engineering.
- Can share one thing I'm passionate about- keeping engineers connected to the business impact of the work that we do. Prioritizing the right thing. That was the motivation behind the dashboad I built. Its monitoring but its also helping us meausre the impact and usefulness of our work. Keeping that as part of the deliverable. Bring up my willingness to share this at eng team meeting once we have some real metrics. Can dig into DD for the frontend. (flesh out these thoughts more)
- How do they decide about the engineering bandwidth in terms of building the engineering roadmap?
	- curious to understand more about how they prioritize features and who is part of those dicussions?
	- how do they track velocity at a higher level? primarily by features?
	- how does the executive team measure or guage engineering effectiveness?
- What would he like to see more from brand experience team?
- Are there aspects of the engineering culture here that he would like to see evolve or adjust?

Feb 1 Discussion topics:

- What I'm working on:
	- brand portal
	- trying to imrpove and make more consistent things like brand access, roles across os-backend. lots of different teams have worked there.
	- auth0 knowledge share

- How things are going:
	- its definitely an enjoyable process to be getting the brand portal off the ground. it felt like we did hit a lull where we were somewhat blocked by product and design work, but for the past two weeks or i think designs and product have been far enough ahead that we've been able to focus more on tasks that are definitely higher impact. When it comes to the product feedback loop, its been at times a pinpoint with lag in that process.
	- I'm looking forward to the hackathon, thanks for setting that up. i think it will especially be nice to hopefully get to work alongside some folks from other parts of the company- that cross-polenation is something that definitely look forward to.

- I've noticed Roy really emphasizing that its about execution, its about delivery for us. That will make or break the company. How is your sense about how the engineering team is doing as a whole? How about the Brand experience team specifically? From your POV what can we be doing better?
- What would he like to see more of from the Brand Experience team?
