# Setting my intention


Affirmations
- I all interactions I will leave ego behind and I will assume people's best intentions
- I affirm my own unique God given journey, that will look different than that of those around me. I will let go of comparing myself, and I seek to be faithful to what God is asking me to do right now. I will let go of inescurity or a sense of "where I should be" at this stage in my career. I will feel peace and security in the ways God has blessed and led my journey, and I will look with anticipating to where he is leading me now.
- I will celebrate the acheivements of those around me.
- I will be a learner today, embracing opportunities to learn from my peers, my leaders, and my mistakes. I will not let my pride or my insecurity get in the way of asking and learning from others.
- I will seek to build genuine connections. I will not see relationships as utility, but I will put myself out there in an effort to make authentic connections. If it is not reciprocated or fruitful, I will not let it affect me, because I am just doing my efforts to be faithful.
- I will not wallow or dwell on my mistakes or shortcomings. I will make many of them. I will use them as chances to grow and improve.
- I will be measured and careful in my responses. I will not lean into hyperbole. I will try to answer as straighforward and accurately as I can in every situation.

Work goals for next 3 months:
- excellence with pilot program project
	- manage resources and tasks well
		- tasks are sequenced efficiently
		- maximize the eng resources by leveraging doms skillset most efficiently and filling in the rest the gaps myself
	- anticipate roadblocks or issues and get ahead of them
- do my part to make relational connections with coworkers. do my part to put myself out there, joke around.
- be strategic and intentional about learning in areas where i am weak
- let go of what i can't control. stop comparing myself to others.

My boundaries:
- I will be militant in removing all distractions that could possibly cost me previous effective time during the day.
- Unless there is an imminent project deadline, I will not work past 730pm. An exception to this rule is if I have to step away for an appointment during the day.

# Prompts

March 3 2022
- take charge and show initiative with the pilot program. proactively coordinate with yang, be thinking ahead, communicate to her my intentions. dig into the trenches and move into the backend work as soon as I can.

- Good
	- I was more locked in than normal during the day. I didn't give into as much compulsive working driven by comparing myself to others.
- Needs improvement
	- Don't just occupy myself with busy work. Frankly I can be killing it there and nobody will notice. I need to find better high impact tasks, I need to look for smart ways that I can be a step ahead, proactively making life better for my teammates or the broader team.
	- Do some looking at how to give better PRs

- be a really good listener and ask good questions
- look at testing strategies for react context and unit testing. what problems do we currently have, what might be better approaches?
- taking initiative to understand the teams problems, looking for what i can improve on the frontend, where i can add the most value
- make sure i have clear action steps both for the team, and for myself when leaving a planning meeting like we just had
- be more locked in during meetings. fully listening. fully thinking through the possibilities, thinking about missed angles. 
- don't be quick to assert myself if im not confident that i now what im talking about (as i did with the CORS issue)

Oct 4

- I didn't poke holes enough, I didn't ask enough questions early.
	- I should have anticipated that we might want to include a "click here to resend" part of the message.
	- I should have asked product early on about how they wanted to position the alert, instead of assuming.
- I should have been more careful about modifying the existing alert and how my changes might now have accounted well for multi-line content or different ways the current alert is being used.
- I didn't test the 5 minute timeout, and didn't raise issues with that alert potentially being stale until it is actively dismissed.

Oct 5

- be always thinking proactively about what i can do to imporove our codebae, our practices, our approach. be more aware about the industry and dev news, best practices so i can potentially be a source to bring those things to the team.

Oct 20

- get better at focusing my effort on high impact / high viz contributions. don't just put my head down and grind away at chores to fill my time or to feel productive. need to be stretching myself to speak up, to think proactively, to get more uncomfortable. i don't need to perform at the level of someone like koty. but i should use him as an example of how i can
