Hey, its great to meet all of you. I'm currently based in Austin, TX, I've been here for a little over 10 years now. 

I started my career in the film industry working as cintematographer largely working in the commercial and documentary space, and then eventually focusing on directing and producing in that space before eventually transitioning into tech, which had always been a passion and something I did on the side for quite a while. 

 Most of my background in tech has been with earlier stage startups. I learned aboud Bond from Nick, who I worked with at my last company. As picked up more about the vision and direction, I felt really aligned and excited about the future. Excited to get to know everyone better and looking forward to working together.

Fun facts:
- I had a somewhat unusual upbringing in that my parents are both physicians are involved in medical training NGOs in the developing world. So by the time I was 18, I had lived 5 different countries and a couple of those years involved going fulltime to school in Russian. My parents definitely beleived in immersing my sister and I into the local culture. It was something I didn't appreciate as much at the time, but its definitely something that as I've gotten older have come to value those experiences. 
- I'm a huge aviation nerd, I've loved airplanes and loved flying ever since I was a little kid. The first thing I ever wanted to be as I was growing up was an airline pilot. I ended up choosing a different path, but a bucket list item of mine was to get a pilots license. That was something I was able to do about 5 years ago. So one of my favorite things to do on a weekend is to go for whats called the 100 dollar burger. Basically what that means is hoping in a plane with a friend or two and going to grab food or taking an afternoon trip somewhere. More commonly in the Austin area that means flying out somewhere to go grab some BBQ.  


 
 Fun facts:
 - things i geek out over:
	 - im a huge aviation nerd, have pretty much loved airplanes and flying my whole life. a bucket list item for my was to get my pilots license. so i was able to do that almost 4 years ago. one of my favorite things is to go for whats called the 100 dollar hamburger. or taking a friend or friends to fly out somewhere for a day trip or for the afternoon.
	 - mildly obsessed with collecting credit card points and miles, and then finding good deals for long haul business class flights. ive got a full spreadsheet where i track everything. and this has taken a hit obviously with covid, but its something looking forward to hopefully resuming in the not too distant future.
- I once spent 10 hours in central asian jail, accused of being a spy. and came pretty close to spending a lot more than that. this is a longer story, but in short I was in film school, i shot my thesis project in central asia. and my trip just happened to coincide with some pretty horrific ethnic voilence in part of the country. i had finished my main production, had a couple more days, and i ended up very naively traveling there with a camera, with the intention documenting some of stories of what had happened. what happened down there is a longer story- but in short i ended up getting arresting, having everything confiscated, and spending 10 harrowing hours in third world jail cell, getting interrogated for half that time. the US embassay got invovled and that was basically the reason why things didn't end up worse.
- I took a bit of a detour before I fully got into the tech. 
	- i went to school for film, and then worked in that world behind the camera as a cinematographer. most of my work was in the commercial / agency space, but i did a decent amount of work in the documentary word as well.
		- the last feature length doc project that I worked on, had theatrical release in 2019. it was one of the more memorable projects, largely because I'm a huge NBA fan. the project was executive produced by steph curry, and featured a number of my basketball heroes in in. so getting to interact in that setting was pretty incredible. 
	- (my favorite documentaries)
		- cartel land, the work, baraka
- i had a somewhat unusual upbring, in that my parents were physicians involved pretty heavily in medical education in developing countries. So by the time I was 18, I had lived in 5 different countries over 3 different continents. And learned to speak Russian fluently in the process. So that had a pretty big impact on me. At the time, its my parents lifestyle and I was along for the ride, but as I've gotten older its something really come to appreciate, and something that definitely shaped my perspective at pretty early age.
