Goals as of March 6:

Things to focus my attention on:
- Pilot Program
	- technical excellence, especially digging in and stretching on the BE
		- anticipate where i need to fill in knowledge, on tooling or bond domain. get ahead of the curve.
	- periodic reviews of the high level execution plan, sequencing, implementation.
		- pipoint any key unknowns or blockers
		- ensure work is sequenced correctly
		- make sure everyone knows what they need to be doing
		- account for follow up, polish steps that need to be documented. 
- Be strategic about taking on tasks and work that will grow me and stretch me
- Don't take the short cut just to get it done quickly. Take the route that will help me learn and understand more deeply, more fully.
- Take a moment to think proactively how I can be more effective today, how our broader team might be more effective

Things to not worry about:
- How much work Koty is doing
- How little work Dom might be doing

(Notes after my first week on the job)
Key goals to focus on:
- Become a better active listener (take notes during meetings and discussions), critical thinker, and questions asker during meetings.
- Forget about what others are doing, and up my internal motivation for excellence and focus during the day. Get ruthless about cuting out distractions and cut out distractions and lock in at the start of each day.
- Getting better at communication, coordination, and collaboration around project features (moving past just IC dev work, and actively building the manager, leadership skillset)
- Invest more heavily into going deeper into the tech and moving past my habit of knowing "just enough" to get it done.
