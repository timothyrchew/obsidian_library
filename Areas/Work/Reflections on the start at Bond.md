What went wrong at Yonder?

- I let my frustrations affect my initiative and I became passive and slunk into the background as time passed
- I didn't go out of my way to put myself out there and build relationships after the very initial time there. I let me relationship engagement taper off quickly.
- I focused too much on just my individual execution. I looked for a predefined, independent, path to take that would minimize my discomfort, and was happy to just opperate within this context.
- I let my own path and engagement and initiative be defined by what those around me were doing. I fell into the standards of those around me, rather than setting my own expectations and charting my own path.
- I was constantly too uptight, serious, and just about the business. I always struggled to let my hair down and have more fun with coworkers.

What do I want to do differently at Bond?

- Make it my first priority to soak up as much about the team, the industry, the culture, current strengths and weaknesses. Listen, ask questions, asses. And then figure out how I can best step in to fill gaps and add value. Be maleable in what this could look like.
- Understand clearly what I need to do in order to get the promotion to Senior. Talk to Yang about this as soon as I get my feet established, make it clear to her this is my immediate goal. Then set up a clear, systematic process for me to move in this direction.
- Spend more time operating outside of my comfort zone. Embrace more chances to stretch, including taking initiative to share my experiences, investing in our dev process, and helping coworkers. Actively look for chances to get infront of other people outside of engineering. Embrace chances to demo and to public speak with the company.
- Go deeper into my tooling. Better understand our dev tools, VScode, scripting. Get better at debugging with my tools (in chrome and in Vscode)
- Go deeper into the frontend best practices, the inner workings of JS and React and our tools.
- Start prepping for my next job on Day 1. Continue learning investing outside of work- both in my next interview and in bettering my on the skill jobs. Actively clarify where I want my career to go and how I will get there. Invest in the skills with the greatest longterm review.

- Become a better listener and consequently, a better contributer in group discussions. Listen carefully. Get better at formulating thoughts and ideas on the fly. Take notes in meetings, jot down ideas, even in big ones where I could get by with just listening.
- I am going to make mistakes, I am going to slip back into old habits. Accept the inevitable misteps and shortcomings. Don't let myself be defined by them. Embrace evolving my identity, role and perception there. I don't have to get it all right. Its better to practice reflection, and intentional incremental improvements.
- Use my time on the job wisely. Ruthlessly cut out distractions and get rid of social media and internet rabbit holes on the job. 
- Continually invest in building relational capital with everyone I meet. Be empathtic, be gracious, be a cheerleader for those around me. Be quick to complement and slow to critique. Figure out who the most strategic people on the eng team are and focus on getting close and establishing raport with them.
- I am going to be frustrated, annoyed, and let down by my expectations for Bond. All companies have issues and frustrations. Build resilience and a positive attitude.
