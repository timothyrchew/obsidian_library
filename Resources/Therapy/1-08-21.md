- mental model for addressing future fears / insecurities in a marriage  
- being held by God, feeling safe. Being able to take it all to him. Having him be my unfailing, listening comforter (how different this was from Christian, who failed me and let me down). He will never abandom me. I can bring him all my sorrow, all my fears. I can trust that he has the right journey ahead of me, that there is always a path forward with him, despite the outcomes of this relationsip  
- I feel like in this time he met me profoudnly. I started getting emotional, and this truth permeated into my heart. I felt closeness, and all I could do was say "Thank you God, you are amazing. Thank you for being here for me".
