- talked about unwanted book from jay stringer. some thigns to think about from childhood influences
	- feeling vulnerable with the moves, the transitions, mom and dad possibly feeling preocupied
	- thinking back to resenting local kyrgyz and their relationships, becuase i felt like they were taking away mom and dads attention
	- the fact that neither mom or dad really modelled sharing or expressing openly their feelings- don't think ive ever seen mom cry and dad only twice in my life. maybe i didn't think it was ok to explore or express my own emotions.



- doing future EMDR on situation where relationship is hard and i start feeling like i made a mistake marrying, i start reverting back to old habits
	- walking through the forrest and coming back to that place where i am held by good, seeking his presence, pouring out my emotions to him, bringing it to him. not bottling up, not stuffing down, not denying or hiding from the pain and the hardship.
	- in some sense this one is harder than my fears about someone else betraying me- because this one i can control and im scared of failing myself, through my own actions and my own choices.
