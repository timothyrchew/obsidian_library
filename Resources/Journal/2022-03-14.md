Thinking about how to frame things that I want to start practicing in day or things I want to improve.

These are the main levers I have at my disposal:
- physical reminders
	- notes, 3x5 cards, checklists
- digital reminders 
	- due app, alarms, app notifications
- environmental prompts
	- organize my space in the way that makes my future action inevitable
- cyclical routines / habits
	- latch desired behavior to the pillars that scaffold my life
		- my shower, my breakfast, lunch, evening review.
