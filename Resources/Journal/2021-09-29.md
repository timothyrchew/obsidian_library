## Something significant from today?

- just finished my 3rd day on the job at BOND. first impressions are that its so different than Yonder- the culture is definitely more buttoned up and a lot less lose and quirky. I think i actually like that. There are some really sharp engineers- and I have also not been totally impressed with the frontend app or the other frontend engs. but everyone has been nice- and there is definitely a higher standard for the code quality. everything is tested, there is clearly more process and structure. jury is out on how much i will like this when im totally settled in, but i am definitely going to get exposed to some new things and different work styles and team dynamics here. i also don't think its going to be super intense and i think i think i will have quite a bit of leash here.

## What am I greatful for?
  
  - im grateful for a new evironment. im thankful for changes and a fresh start. 
  - its so nice to have BAZ here, im thankful for the time with them
  - im thankful for the chosen- im glad to introduce lara to jesus this way and its changing me as well.
  
## What would make tomorrow great and how can I improve from today?

- get back into my full routine. buckle down.

## What am I thinking about, relfecting on, learning?

- where is this going? now that i have this next stage in motion, its time to really start charting out this next season and where i maximize my efforts and focus.
