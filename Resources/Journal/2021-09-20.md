## Something significant from today?

Kicked off the first true day of vacation of my week off before Bond. Stayed reasonably productive and focused today. BAZ left home today and are currently in the middle of the trip back home.

## What am I greatful for?
  
  Grateful for this time off for reflection and refocusing.
  
## What would make tomorrow great?

Work smart. Time to move beyond planning, research, brainstorming. Time to start doing the important shit.

## What can I improve on from today?
