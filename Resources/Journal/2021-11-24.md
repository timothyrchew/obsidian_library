What does repentence look like in light of my relationship with LL? What do I need to repend of as I earnestly seeks God's guidance in this area?

--

What are possible things I need to repent of?
- sexual immorality
- being unwise about moving forward in my relationship with lara early on despite the big hurddles to overcome around faith. choosing to go against what would have generally been wise counsel at the time
- my bullheadedness in moving forward, doing things my own way, turning my back on god
- my choice to "see whats so bad" for myself, distrusting God
- letting my convictions go, ignoring and dulling my conscience. being totally ok with living in hypocrisy, especially around sexuality
	- on saying "well, we've already gone this far, what difference doees it make" to try to change
- on selfishness in starting the relationship when at the start when i knew that the faith thing would probably come to a head at some point. of the risk of heartbreak i brough on both of us, but especially and most significantly on lara.
