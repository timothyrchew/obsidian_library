## Something significant from today?

- first day of my second week at Bond. put in my first real code PR today. very quickly im becoming more aware of things I can do better, picking up good examples from others here. i tend to beat myself up and feel like im not doing a great job, or that im falling behind where i ought to be in relation to others. But the good part is that I do see how I will have chances to really grow and be stretched in different ways here.

## What am I greatful for?
  
  - the chance to learn. the fact that i felt stagnant at yonder. regardless of how things turn out at Bond over the long term, I will have more opportunities to grow and stretch here over this next season.
  
## What would make tomorrow great and how can I improve from today?

- start my day with a real hunger to conquer what is infront of me. don't worry about others. stop comparing myself to others or worrying about other people standards. set my goals, set up my aim, and then focus on being the best version of myself that I can possibly be. focus on finishing the day and being able to look back with the satisfaction of really grinding towards the things i set up for myself. 

## What am I thinking about, relfecting on, learning?
