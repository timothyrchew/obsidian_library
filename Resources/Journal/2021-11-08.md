Where am I still holding back? What else do we still need to talk about?

- I will admit that I have held back a bit on sharing my more nuanced view on homosexuality. I'm scared that it will scare her away from faith. I'm scared that we could have to navigate that together with our child and that we would end up in very different places. I'm also not truly sure how I feel, and I want to lean towards grace and love. I'm scared that she will think I'm a judgemental person if I show anything other than fullhearted acceptance.
	- I think this is probably the last piece I need to fully share with her. Its the most prominent thing that comes to mind right now.
