Father what does it look like for me to re-surrender to you? To move past my stubborn-ness, and my thinking that I know whats best, or that I can figure it out for myself?

I confess that I have thought, and probably still think just about the material consequences and the expense of trusting you in things areas like sex and porn.

I confess that I want to do it my own way, and that I have placed my own pleasure and my own desire above you.

Father help me to grow. Help me to move past my selfishness. I want to put you back in the place you belong in my life, and the head of it all. I want to surrender in these areas that are so ingraned, so a part of my nature. Father help me in my unbeleif, help me in my stubbornness, help me in my sin, in my rebellion.

Father I want to open myself and to offer myself as sacrifice to you. I want to walk and learn from you, humbly and reverently. You are God and I am not. Help this truth to permeate my entire being, my thoughts, my actions, my relationship.
