Father, help me to carefully consider the wisdom in corinthians about not being unequally yoked. 

Help me to see clearly how this would play out with Lara. Help us to have honest conversations, to serfuce the ways this could play out and be a source of difficutly for us. 

Help me to be honest with myself about how being with her might hinder or affect my individual relationship with you.

I ask that you would give me more clarity about what you are calling me to in the future, so that I can talk more tangibly to Lara about this, using specifics and details. 

Help her to take more steps forward. Increase the desire, the hunger. Grant her to eyes to see the smae beauty in faith and your word that you have shown me. 

My deepest desire is that she would come to fully know and commit to you, to experience your beauty and goodness. That I would be able to lead her, without any pressure, to point her to you.

Oh Lord, help me in this impossible situation, impossible decision. I am yours. Speak to me please. Guide me, I need you.
