## Something significant from yesterday?

- Lara and I had a detailed talk about my holding on out on proposing to her, what i am truly needing from from a faith perspective, and whether it is truly about her needing to become a christian. No clear takeaways, but we are going to be more intenttional about continueing to explore with the notion to figure out what she doesnt agree with and what she resonates wtih. We are going to start watching The Chosen together this week.
