# Chapter 1 - The Critical Journey
"we make the mistake of thinking that people at those stages are somehow better. On the journey of faith, this is not the case."

"we submit, however, that each of us has a specific home stage (some report two home stages of equal intensity) wher we operate most of the time and which best characterizes our life of faith. If you cannot identify a home stage, it may be because you are  in a transition from one stage to another."

"a crisis can knock us off balance, makibng us afriad, vulterable and ripe for change. this also happens in our spiritual journey. we have a crisis in our faith that causes us to reconsider. it might frighten us, at least make us vulnerable. If we become biter or too resistant, we can get very stuck. But if we let the change or crisis touch us, if we live with it and embrace it as difficult as that is, we are more likely to grow and to move eventually to another stage or spiral in our journey. when we are most vulerable, we have the best chance to learn and move along the way. in the midst of pain there is promise"

"the impetus for movement is frequently an event or experience of our lives over which we have little control. some mentioned to us are: a health crisis, change in relationships, models of others we want to emulate, a teacher, reaching person limits, deep qusetionss about ones self, being hurt, reponding to others needs, experiencing God in a new way, telling your own story to another, loss of a relationship, death, developing a quiet time, losing truths once held dear, longing for God"

# Chapter 2 - Sharing Our Journeys

"Deepening my faith meant transforming my life. For me, there was no other choice. As an example of these changes, my life purpose in the first year of spiritual direction was to be a wise leader. In the second year, it was to be wise. year three was completed with no purpose at all, an experience I now see as an example of the dark night of the soul. In the fourth year, my purpose evolved into just being available. years five and six and on had the purpose of simply loving. My work has not changed radically. I have changed."
